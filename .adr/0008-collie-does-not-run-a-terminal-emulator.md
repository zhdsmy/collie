# 0008 — Collie does not run a terminal emulator

Status: **Accepted** (2026-08-04)

## Context

"Render the pane properly, with a real terminal emulator" is the most re-proposed idea in this repo,
and it will be proposed again. [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md) §8 parked it against one
objection — raw ANSI frames need an emulator, and rendering those in the browser would breach §6's
"pane output is React text nodes only" boundary — which reads as *we would, if it were safe*. So it
came back in a form that is safe: a **headless** emulator in the bridge, rendering to a cell grid the
phone draws as text nodes. The boundary objection does not touch that version, and it deserves a real
answer rather than the same parking spot.

The answer is that the boundary was never the strongest objection. Three others are.

### The emulation already happened, one process upstream

`pane.read` does not return a byte stream. It returns **Herdr's rendered grid** — the screen as it
currently looks, one line per visual row at the pane's real width, with SGR reattached. Cursor motion,
screen clears and scroll regions have all been *applied* by the time Collie sees anything, which is
precisely why an SGR-only parser has been sufficient for a year.

Two measurements in [`HERDR_API.md`](../HERDR_API.md) show this directly rather than by assertion: an
alt-screen pane returns exactly the viewport and nothing behind it (no scrollback ring to read), and
`recent_unwrapped` is **byte-identical** to `recent` for Claude panes because the harness renderer has
already hard-wrapped the prose. Both facts only hold downstream of a renderer.

An emulator in the bridge would therefore re-emulate an already-emulated screen. That is not a
fidelity gain; it is a second renderer disagreeing with the first.

### The bug history it is proposed to fix is semantic, not graphical

The case for an emulator is usually assembled from the mirror's scar tissue. Each scar has a
documented root cause, and they do not point where the proposal points:

| Reported | Actual root cause | Fixed by an emulator? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #5 — broken TUI tables, viewport blowout | Rendering and CSS at phone width | No |
| #53 — pans on nearly every line | Pane spawned at the desktop's column count; wrap-vs-column-faithful is a product choice, settled toward wrap in 0.21.0 | No — and a cell grid reopens it |
| #54 / #56 — send stalls under a tall statusline | `locateInputBox` — *which rows are the input box* ([ADR 0004](./0004-the-statusline-run-is-bounded.md)) | No — inference over content |
| #50 / #51 — dialogs fall through to the raw mirror | A wrapped option label; a shape no grammar had a rule for | No — inference over content |
| pane stuck narrow ([#167](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/issues/167)) | Herdr applies pane geometry only while a desktop client is attached (upstream `herdr#1709`) | No — server-side PTY |

Every one is either geometry Collie does not own or a question about meaning. A TUI paints cells; it
does not paint structure. *Which rows are the input box* is not more answerable from a
better-rendered grid, because the grid never contained the answer.

### The grammars would not get simpler — but their safety net would break

The grammars are already position-agnostic. They consume `StyledLine[]` — final rendered rows — and
derive their columns from **text**: `preview-select.ts:161` locates its gutter with
`indexOf("Notes:")`, and `OPTION_LABEL_START` (`:109`) matches a numbered row by regex. Exactly one
detector in 1 766 lines reads styling at all — `wizard.ts:142` filters `s.bg !== undefined` to find
the current stepper chip, and says so in its header comment. Nothing in there is waiting for cells.

What an emulator *would* do is invalidate the corpus underneath them. **34 byte-faithful captures and
1 757 lines of Claude grammar tests** are pinned to `pane.read` output, and
[`HARNESS_CONTRIBUTING.md`](../HARNESS_CONTRIBUTING.md)'s Tier-2 bar rests on them. A second renderer
differs in exactly the ways captures are sensitive to — trailing blanks, blank-line normalisation — so
adoption means either normalising emulator output to byte-match `pane.read` (engineering with no
user-visible product) or re-capturing everything (discarding the spine to build the thing the spine
protects). This cost is invisible in the proposal and is the largest one in it.

### What it would actually buy, priced honestly

Two things. Neither requires an emulator to obtain.

- **Latency** (~2 s → live). Real, and felt every session. But staleness is a property of *how a read
  is requested*, not of what draws it: `pane.read` already returns a `revision`, the bridge already
  holds an `events.subscribe` stream, and pane reads are already 304-cached. A live-feeling mirror is
  a transport change to a contract that is probed, tested and cached today.
- **Cursor position** — the one signal the snapshot genuinely lacks, and the real prize.
  [ADR 0004](./0004-the-statusline-run-is-bounded.md) says in its own revisit clause that *established*
  box liveness would retire both the statusline bound and the scrollback-echo limitation it cannot
  fix. But an emulator is an extravagant way to acquire one field. Herdr has accepted two Collie
  issues already (`herdr#1709`, `herdr#2250`); an accepted upstream field lands cursor **inside** the
  existing contract, with no second renderer and no corpus migration.

### `control` is worse than not using it, and `observe` is unprobed

`control` accepts `terminal.resize` against the **shared** PTY and arbitrates with
one-controller-at-a-time semantics plus `--takeover`. Adopting it means Collie fights the person at
the desk, and "fixes" the narrow pane for the phone by breaking the desktop. Collie already has every write path
it needs on the socket — `send_text` and `send_keys`, one-shot and stateless.

> **Amended (2026-09-05, [#167](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/issues/167) and the auto-zoom
> proposal).** The clause above argues from `control`'s takeover semantics, which reads as though a
> gentler transport would be allowed. It would not. **The same refusal covers the socket's own
> geometry methods** — `pane.zoom`, `pane.resize`, and any future write that moves a rect — because
> the reason underneath does not depend on the transport: a pane's geometry is the operator's screen,
> and Collie does not write it. That is
> [ADR 0031](./0031-freshness-is-a-declared-promise.md)'s rule, stated there for focus — the phone
> moves the terminal **only** on the named "Show in terminal" tap, never as a side effect of
> navigation. A pane Collie widened because the phone opened it is exactly such a side effect.
>
> Auto-zoom was proposed for #167 and declined on a second ground as well, which is worth recording
> because it inverts the usual trade: `herdr#1709` states that `pane.zoom` and `pane.resize` **do not
> move a detached session's PTY at all**. Probed 2026-09-05 against herdr with a client attached, zoom
> did resize the PTY (a 54×16 pane redrew `top` at 97+ columns, unzoom restored 54) — so the write is
> inert in the case that motivates it (nobody at the desk, which is when the phone is the only client)
> and effective only in the case that forbids it (someone at the desk, whose layout would jump).

And `HERDR_API.md` verifies **nothing** about `observe`/`control`: not the frame format, not whether
cursor state is even in it, not multi-observer semantics, not a version floor. It is a CLI
child-process contract, not the socket. This repo's habit is to probe before building — the habit that
produced the `recent_unwrapped` correction and the bracketed-paste finding, both of which killed a
plausible theory.

## Decision

**Collie does not run a terminal emulator — not in the browser, not in the bridge. The mirror renders
the rows Herdr already rendered, and the client contract stays `StyledLine[]`.**

- **Client-side emulation (xterm.js and its relatives) is refused outright**, and not only on the XSS
  boundary. It replaces the entire styled-line pipeline — the [ADR 0002](./0002-invert-the-light-terminal-mirror.md)
  inversion, tappable links, find highlighting, the wrap default — with a large dependency writing DOM
  at the most attacker-influenced surface in the product.
- **Latency complaints route to transport.** If the mirror feels stale, the fix is how the client asks
  for a read, never what draws it.
- **Cursor and liveness are an upstream ask first.** File against Herdr's `pane.read` /
  `session.snapshot`; build nothing locally to synthesise what a field would give.
- **A cell-grid wire protocol is refused even inside a hypothetical emulator.** The phone shows ~50 of
  a ~200-column pane, so a column-faithful grid reopens the pan-vs-wrap question 0.21.0 settled toward
  wrap.

## Consequences

- **The mirror is exactly as faithful as Herdr's own render, and no more.** Where that render is wrong
  for a phone — the frozen pane geometry of
  [#167](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/issues/167) — Collie is wrong with it, and the fix is
  upstream. Accepted.
- **Dialogs will keep falling through to the raw mirror** when no grammar recognises them. Fall-through
  is the safe direction (real text, nothing wrongly tappable), and the capability ladder is built for
  the gap to be closed by a grammar — usually a contributor's, which is how #51 and #61 arrived.
- **ADR 0004's scrollback-echo limitation stands** until cursor arrives from upstream. It cannot be
  closed by inference, and this decision declines to close it by re-rendering.
- **The fixture corpus stays deliberately coupled to `pane.read` output.** That coupling is now a
  decision rather than an accident, and anything that would break it inherits the cost of re-capturing.
- **Herdr's `[theme]` and its own UI stay irrelevant to what Collie draws** — unchanged by this, but
  worth restating, since "use a real emulator" is sometimes proposed as the way to match the desktop's
  colours. It would not; see [ADR 0002](./0002-invert-the-light-terminal-mirror.md).

### What would justify revisiting

- **Herdr exposing cursor position** in `pane.read` or `session.snapshot`. This is the outcome to
  *pursue*, because it removes the strongest argument for an emulator without building one.
- **That ask being refused, plus measured evidence that inference is failing in the field** — ADR
  0004's echo precondition actually firing, or a real dialog only cursor can disambiguate. Then the
  shape is already constrained, and this ADR is superseded rather than amended: **read-only `observe`,
  bridge-side, open pane only, behind a flag, emitting today's `PaneReadResponse` plus a `cursor`
  field** so that no grammar and no fixture changes. Phase 0 is a probe written into `HERDR_API.md`;
  it does not begin before `bridge/server.ts` has the integration coverage it currently lacks, because
  a child-process stream would be the riskiest I/O the bridge has ever owned.
- **Herdr putting the real PTY size on the pane record**, beside `scroll.viewport_rows`. Today a
  client cannot tell a pane's true width: `layout`'s rect can report the new full width over a PTY
  still stuck at the old one (`herdr#1709`), so any narrow-pane hint Collie showed would sometimes be
  a confident lie. With that field, a one-line read-only hint on a provably narrow pane becomes
  honest and cheap. It does **not** reopen the emulator question, and it does not license a write.
- **Latency staying bad after the transport work.** If a live-feeling mirror proves unreachable without
  frame streaming, that is a genuinely new fact and not a re-run of this argument.
