## Context

An operator with three machines in a crew could see every agent on each of them and nothing about
the machines themselves. A build that pins a laptop's CPU for an hour, or a member that runs out of
memory, was found by walking over to it. The phone already talks to the lead, and the lead already
asks every member for its snapshot on every sweep, so the fact was one field away.

## Decision

1. **Each Collie samples its own machine, on the tick it already has.** `MachineSampler` reads CPU,
   memory, load and network from the `StateEngine.onTick` listener list, at most once every 15 s,
   and at most once every 5 s while a phone asked for `GET /api/machines` in the last 30 s
   (`MachineWatch.sampleEveryMs`). There is no second timer and no child process
   (CREW_PROTOCOL.md §10.1, §11; macOS memory is the one exception, see the amendment below). The idle tick is 12 s, so an unwatched machine samples every 24 s,
   two or three times a minute, and any tick up to 60 s still puts a reading in every minute: the
   80% coverage rule in point 4 holds without a page open. A sample needs two readings, and the
   first sample after a start comes at the 5 s pace, so a machine that just started or joined shows
   its load within seconds. A member samples at the idle rate, since
   only the lead sees the phone, and the lead's sweep reads its last sample; a sweep that finds the
   same sample again skips it (point 2), and member readings are at most 36 s apart, so no minute
   goes empty for it either. One sample costs about 0.05 ms of parsing and 0.15 ms of kernel reads
   on a 16-core machine with 33 interfaces (measured 2026-10-05), mostly `/proc/net/dev`. On Linux
   the core count comes from `/proc/stat` too, so `os.cpus()` is not called there. On Linux CPU
   comes from the aggregate line of `/proc/stat`, with iowait counted as idle, because Bun's
   `os.cpus()` there drops iowait, softirq and steal (measured 2026-10-05 under Bun 1.4.1: each core's
   times are exactly 10 x the jiffies for user, nice, sys, idle and irq, and nothing else). Memory on
   Linux is `MemTotal - MemAvailable`, so the page cache is not counted as used. Network on Linux is
   `/proc/net/dev` over the physical interfaces only: loopback, bridges (`br*`, `docker*`, `virbr*`,
   `cni*` and the like), veth and tap ends, tunnels (`tailscale*`, `wg*`, `tun*`, `zt*`), bonds and
   VLANs are left out, because their bytes also cross a physical interface and would be counted twice
   (`isSkippedInterface` holds the list). Every other platform reads `node:os`: CPU from `os.cpus()`, memory
   from `totalmem - freemem`, no network, and no load average on Windows, where Node answers zeros.
   *Amended 2026-10-10 (#383): on macOS `os.freemem()` is only the free and speculative pages, so the file
   cache read as used and a Mac sat at 88 to 98 %. macOS memory now comes from one `/usr/bin/vm_stat` run
   per sample (an async `Bun.spawn`, killed after 1 s, started from the tick and never awaited, at most one
   in flight, the one child process this sampler starts), and its answer is served on the next sample, one
   tick late. Until the first answer, or when the held one is older than three idle sample intervals, memory
   is the old `totalmem - freemem`, also after a failed run. The figure is app
   (`Anonymous pages - Pages purgeable`) plus wired plus compressed, what Activity Monitor calls Memory
   Used, against `os.totalmem()`. Windows keeps `totalmem - freemem`.*

2. **A member's reading rides the answer it already gives.** `machineStats` is an additive-optional
   sibling of the `/crew/v1/snapshot` body, beside `version`, `updatePreflight` and `updateRun`. The
   peer reads the sample it holds, so the answer does no disk read. The lead parses it defensively:
   any field that is not a finite number in range drops the whole sample. It stamps the sample on
   its own clock (§10.2). A sample equal in every field to the last one taken for that member is
   the same reading served again, and is neither recorded nor stamped: that is what a member whose
   sampler hangs sends, and stamping it fresh would draw a live, flat machine forever. A real
   reading that repeats another in every field is not expected, since CPU and network are ratios of
   counters over time and memory is counted in bytes, and skipping one costs a single point.
   `X-Crew-Protocol` stays `2`.

3. **The history is the lead's, not each member's.** The lead (or a solo Collie) keeps one bucket per
   minute per machine for 24 hours: CPU average and maximum, memory fraction, and network averages.
   It holds them in fixed typed arrays, about 68 KiB per machine for the full day, and persists them
   to `machine-history.json` from the tick, at most once every five minutes and only when a minute
   changed, and on shutdown, atomic and owner-only. The file is version 2: per machine the first
   minute, the last minute's reading count, and one row per minute
   `[minutes since the last row, cpu, cpuMax, mem, rx, tx]`, fractions to 3 decimals. A version 1
   file still loads. A day of one machine is about 46 KiB on disk (54 KiB with a disk reported), against 80 KiB before. A peer keeps nothing. The phone asks the lead for everything, so
   history kept on a peer would need a forwarded route and a second copy of the same day, and would
   still be lost with that peer. A removed member's history and alert rules are dropped with it, live
   and again on the next save for a member removed while the lead was down. A bucket more than a
   minute in the future, left by a clock that stepped back, is dropped on record and on load. The
   writes go through one chain, and the shutdown flush waits for it. A deposed lead (§18.12) records,
   judges and pushes nothing.

4. **One rule per metric per machine, judged by a pure function.** Rules live in
   `machine-alerts.json` on the lead, keyed by member id, written on change only. A rule fires when
   every complete minute in its window is at or above the line and at least 80% of the window has
   data. The episode closes after five straight complete minutes below the line minus 0.05. Open
   episodes are saved with the rules, so a restart does not push twice. An unreachable machine
   neither opens nor closes an episode: missing data is not a recovery. Alerts report sustained high
   load only; a machine that goes offline sends no push.

5. **The push is the cache warning's shape.** `type: "machine"`, tag
   `collie:machine:<id>:<metric>`, title codes `machine.cpu` and `machine.mem`, and
   `data: { target: "machine", machine: <id> }` so a tap opens `/machines/<id>`. The id is not in
   `host`: an old cached service worker reads `host` as a crew member and opens `/?h=<id>`, which
   names no member on a solo Collie (id `local`); with no `host` it opens the dashboard. The collapse
   topic is one per machine and metric, `collie-machines-` and the first 12 base64url characters of
   the SHA-256 of `<id>:<metric>` (28 characters, `machineTopic` in `bridge/push.ts`), so two alerts
   queued for an offline phone do not replace each other at the push service. It respects the snooze, and a
   snooze records nothing, so a value that outlasts it still pushes. The new `NotifyPrefs.machines`
   switch is on by default, because a rule is something the operator set on purpose.

6. **Three routes, on the lead and on a solo Collie.** `GET /api/machines`,
   `GET /api/machines/:id/history` and `POST /api/machines/:id/alerts`. Two queries are
   additive-optional, and an answer without them is byte-identical to the one before them:
   `?spark=N` (1 to 60) adds `spark: { stepMs, cpu, mem }` to each row with a reading in that
   window, the last N complete minutes oldest first, `null` for a missing minute, 2 decimals, leading
   empty minutes cut; `?since=<ms>` makes the history answer only the minutes starting at or after
   it. History fractions are rounded to 3 decimals. A malformed query value is ignored. A peer answers 404
   `crew.not_lead`, like `/api/crew`. None is forwardable with `?host=`. The POST takes the write gate
   and is audited as `machine.alerts`, with the machine in `host`. A row's id is the
   `CrewMemberStatus.id` of `GET /api/crew`, the lead's own row included. A solo Collie that never
   enrolled answers one row, id `local`.

7. **Solo zero-tax is renegotiated on purpose.** The three routes and the two files join the
   solo-baseline goldens. `machine-alerts.json` appears only after the first rule.
   `machine-history.json` appears after five minutes of running. No snapshot key is added, the
   browser's snapshot bytes are unchanged, and nothing is written by a bridge that is only started
   and stopped.

8. **The phone reads only what is on screen.** The list's loader asks for the census with
   `?spark=30`, on the poll loop, and keeps the identity of every row that did not change
   (`keepCensusIdentity`), so the memoised cards and sparks draw only when their row moved. A
   machine's page reads the whole day once, then once a minute while visible only the minutes from
   its newest point on (`?since=`), merged by `mergeHistory`; the memoised charts draw once a minute,
   not on the poll. The dashboard's Crew tab (ADR 0085) shows the same card, read on mount and every
   15 s while the tab is on screen and the page is visible, one round at a time, and it reads
   nothing on any other tab (ADR 0066 point 4). A tap on a card goes down to `/machines/<id>`, and
   because `/` is a legitimate parent of a machine (`ancestorsOf`), back steps onto the dashboard,
   which opens on the tab it stored (ADR 0067). A machine that answers but sends no new reading for
   two minutes is called stale: its numbers are quieted and its age is said in words.

9. **Disks too, read with `statfs` and never on the tick's time.** A sample carries an optional
   `disks: [{ mount, used, total }]` in bytes (`bridge/machine-disks.ts`). The filesystems are the
   ones holding the home folder, the root (the system drive on Windows) and Collie's state folder,
   with symlinks resolved. A filesystem is left out when it is under 1 GiB, or read-only with no free
   block: a Fedora Atomic root is a 34 MiB composefs image at 100 %, and it must never show or alert
   (on Linux the `ro` flag comes from `/proc/self/mounts`; elsewhere "no free block, the root reserve
   included" stands in for it). Two paths on one device are one disk, and so are two filesystems with
   the same type, size and free space (APFS volumes in one container, btrfs subvolumes, where a
   platform gives no device id); the fuller is kept, at most four. `used` is `df`'s Used and `total`
   is `used` plus the space an unprivileged process can still write, so `used / total` is `df`'s Use%
   (`df`'s Size also counts the root reserve, so `total` can be a few percent under it). The label is
   the mount point on Unix, found by walking up while the device id stays the same, and the drive
   (`C:`) on Windows. The reads are async and fire-and-forget: the sampler's tick STARTS a round at
   most once a minute and returns, each path is its own slot, a path whose read is still out is
   skipped and not stacked (a hung network mount costs one pending promise, not one a minute), and a
   path whose last answer is over three minutes old is left out rather than served stale. No child
   process. Between rounds every sample carries the last answer. The lead validates `disks`
   defensively (a string mount without control characters, `0 <= used <= total`, `total > 0`) and
   keeps the first four of a longer list. `disks` is part of the "same sample" comparison in point 2:
   a healthy machine repeats its disks for a minute by design, but CPU and memory still move.
   The history keeps a seventh value per minute, the FULLEST disk's fraction as a running average,
   `null` on a minute with none; the file row grows a seventh element only on such a minute, and a
   version 2 file written before it loads with `null`. The disk alert (`MachineAlerts.disk`, title
   code `machine.disk`, tag `collie:machine:<id>:disk`, topic `machineTopic(id, "disk")`) is judged
   by the same evaluator on that fraction, and a minute with no disk value is a missing minute. The
   push body names the machine, the fullest mount, the percent and the minutes. Verified on Linux
   (Bun 1.4.1) only; on macOS and Windows `fs.statfs` is Bun's libuv call, and a rejection there
   simply means no disks are reported.

10. **A machine's page has two views, Status and Alerts, and the view is in the URL.** Under the
    header a `ui/segmented.tsx` tablist offers Status (the numbers, a bar per disk, the 1 h | 24 h
    switch and four charts: CPU, memory, disk, network) and Alerts (the rules for CPU, memory and
    disk, the push note and the link to Settings, Alerts). Status is the page with no parameter;
    Alerts is `?tab=alerts`, built by `machinePath(id, scope, "alerts")` and read by `machineTabOf`.
    A switch is ADR 0067's SIDE move: it replaces the entry and carries its `from` over, so both
    views are one level, and Back leaves the machine for wherever it was opened from, never onto the
    other view. A machine alert push opens Status (its URL has no parameter), where the numbers are.
    The "Alert firing" line on Status and on a card is a link to Alerts, where the rule is; on the
    card it sits above the stretched tap. While a rule fires, the Alerts segment carries a dot whose
    accessible name is "Alerts, alert firing". The history is read only while Status shows, and
    coming back to Status asks only for the minutes since the newest point held. The disk rule is
    offered only for a machine that reports disks, or one that already holds a disk rule.

## Not built

- **Per-process figures.** A reading is per machine. Which process is busy is a question for the
  terminal on that machine.
- **History on a peer.** Covered in point 3.
- **Alerts while the lead is down.** The lead judges. When it is down nobody records and nobody
  judges, and the chart shows a gap.
- **An alert for a machine that goes offline.** The crew page already shows a member's health; an
  alert here reports sustained high load only.
- **History and rules that follow the lead.** A deputy that takes over starts with no alert rules
  and no history: both files stay on the old lead. A solo Collie that becomes a lead changes its own
  id from `local` to its member id, and the `local` history and rules are dropped on the next save.
- **Network figures off Linux.** No `node:os` source exists for them without a child process.
- **A disk history per filesystem, and a disk spark.** The history keeps the fullest filesystem only,
  which is what the alert judges; the bars say which one it is now. A disk moves over days, so the
  card shows "Disk 66%" with no spark.

## Consequences

- ADR 0034 holds: readings travel on the crew link and stay on the lead. Nothing is collected or
  sent outside the crew.
- A member older than this feature sends no reading. Its row says "no sample", never zero.
- The day of minutes costs the lead about 68 KiB of memory per machine (14 KiB of it the disk value)
  and 46 KiB on disk, 54 KiB with a disk reported (measured 2026-10-05: 8.4 KiB for the seventh value
  over a day), rewritten at most every five minutes and only when it changed. Ten machines take about
  3 ms to serialise and write.
- A round of disk reads costs the tick about 13 µs to start (three `statfs`, a few `stat` and one
  `/proc/self/mounts` read, measured 2026-10-05 on this machine), and its I/O finishes off the tick
  in well under a millisecond, once a minute. A sample with one disk is 73 B more on the crew link
  and in the census (two disks, 127 B).
- On the wire, the census is about 340 B per machine raw (`?spark=30` about 680 B), plus 73 B per
  disk row. The whole day of one machine is about 70 KiB raw, 19 KiB gzipped, read once per page
  visit (the seventh value adds 5 to 6 B per point, about 7 KiB raw a day and under 1 KiB gzipped);
  each minute after is a few hundred bytes.
