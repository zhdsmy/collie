# 0032 — A worktree is opened by the multiplexer, not by Git

## Context

Starting fresh work from the phone means starting it in whatever checkout the pane already sits in
([#133](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/issues/133)). Branching off and putting an agent on it is a
walk back to the desk — the one thing Collie exists to remove.

There is a cheaper route than the one below, it is obvious, and it will be proposed again. **Collie
already runs on the host; `git worktree add` is one command; `createSpace` already opens a space at a
path.** Two calls Collie can make today, no port change, no capability, and it works on every adapter
that can make a space. It is the right instinct — the mux port must not grow a vendor's feature list
— and it is why this decision needs writing down rather than merely making.

It fails on what happens next, and the failure is not visible on the day it ships.

**Herdr does not merely run `git worktree add`; it keeps a record.** Probed 2026-08-28 against herdr
0.8.2: `worktree.list` answers with `open_workspace_id` per checkout, and the session snapshot carries
a `worktree` block on every workspace (`repo_key`, `repo_root`, `checkout_path`,
`is_linked_worktree`). That record is the whole feature: it is how the phone knows which checkouts
exist, which of them a space is already showing, and which space to nest under which repo. A checkout
made behind Herdr's back has none of it — Herdr's desktop cannot show it as open, and Collie could
only list it by doing its own Git work and then reconciling two answers about the same directory.

Removal makes the point sharper still, and it is worth stating even though this decision does not
implement it: Herdr's `worktree.remove` is addressed **by workspace**, with no path-addressed form at
all. So a checkout created outside Herdr's bookkeeping could never be removed through the socket —
the verb would have nothing to name. The cheap route does not produce a worse worktree; it produces
one nothing can clean up.

The second problem is placement. Herdr puts linked worktrees under `~/.herdr/worktrees/<repo>/<branch>`
and the operator's desktop finds them there. A Collie that chose its own directory would scatter
checkouts a running Herdr already had opinions about.

So the question is not "may the port know about Git". It is: **who owns the mapping from a checkout
to the space showing it?** Whoever owns it must do the creating, because the record is made at
creation time and cannot be reconstructed afterwards.

## Decision

**A worktree verb asks the multiplexer, never Git. Three declared capabilities —
`listWorktrees`, `createWorktree`, `openWorktree` — with three routes behind them.**

- **The port speaks checkouts and spaces, not Git.** `MuxWorktree` carries a path, a branch, and the
  space showing it; there is no ref, no remote, no status. What the port asks for is the act that
  ends in a space appearing, moving or going away — which is a multiplexer's job — and the Git
  underneath is the adapter's business.
- **Removal is NOT in this decision.** Collie has no `closeSpace` capability, and Herdr's
  `worktree.remove` closes the space with the checkout — so shipping it here would hand Collie its
  first space-destroying verb through a side door. `MuxWorktree.openSpaceId` is carried anyway,
  because it is what tells the phone which checkouts are already spaces; removal can be added later
  against that same field, deliberately, as its own argument.
- **`focus` is never sent.** Creating from the phone must not move the operator's own screen; the
  phone navigates itself. Changing what the terminal shows stays `setFocus`, which is its own
  capability for exactly this reason.
- **Herdr declares all three; tmux and zellij decline them, with reasons.** tmux could shell out to
  Git, but it keeps no record tying a checkout to the session showing it, so what it produced could
  not be listed or removed again. Declining is the honest answer until an adapter keeps that mapping
  itself and a probe proves it.

## Alternatives rejected

- **`git worktree add` + `createSpace` (the cheap route).** Rejected above: it creates checkouts the
  multiplexer cannot remove, in a directory it did not choose. Its one real advantage — working on
  tmux too — buys a worse feature on the adapter every current operator runs.
- **One umbrella `worktrees` capability.** Rejected because the repo splits by the control that
  appears or does not (`createTab`/`renameTab`/`closeTab`), and these are three separate affordances.
  An umbrella would also force an adapter that could only create to declare it could also list.
- **Version-gating the declaration on Herdr's protocol number.** Rejected as a change of mechanism
  smuggled in with a feature: no capability is gated that way today, and an old Herdr already answers
  an unknown method with a refusal the phone can show.

## Consequences

- **Three rows in the matrix, three columns each, and every Herdr cell owes a probe.** Paid: the
  cells cite a first-hand probe of herdr 0.8.2 on 2026-08-28.
- **`createWorktree` is not atomic and callers must treat it as two steps.** Probed: in a session
  with no window server the checkout was created and the open failed with `worktree_open_failed` —
  the branch exists and nothing shows it. Recovery is `openWorktree`, never a second create, which
  answers `worktree_create_failed` because the path is taken. The UI says so.
- **Nothing is removed from the phone at all yet.** A worktree can be listed, created and opened; a
  checkout that has outlived its use is still cleaned up at the desk.
- **What would justify revisiting this.** A second multiplexer growing real worktree bookkeeping (so
  the capability stops being one vendor's), or Collie deciding what it means to destroy a space —
  which is the argument `removeWorktree` is waiting on, not a missing line of code.

## Addendum — 2026-10-07: Herdr 0.9.3 no longer puts the repo on the workspace

Status is unchanged: **Accepted**. Nothing above this line is rewritten.

On herdr 0.9.3 (protocol 22) the workspace row's `worktree` field is absent. The schema still lists
it, but `workspace.list` and `session.snapshot` leave it off every workspace, Git ones included. So
no space carried `repoRoot` or `isWorktree`, and the worktree rows never showed.

The adapter now asks `worktree.list` by workspace id, once per workspace. The answer is cached while
the workspace exists and cleared when the event stream reconnects; a failure other than
`not_git_worktree` is asked again after 60 s. `repoRoot` is `source.repo_root`. `isWorktree` is
`is_linked_worktree` of the entry whose `open_workspace_id` is the workspace, and `folder` is that
entry's path. `source.source_checkout_path` is not used: asked from inside a linked worktree, it
still names the repo's main checkout. The call never sends `trust_repository`, which Herdr reserves
for a repository the operator has checked.

The 0.8.2 row field stays first: when a row carries `worktree`, it is read and no call is made. The
real 0.9.3 answers are captured in `bridge/mux/herdr/captures/workspaces-0.9.3.json`.
