# Architecture decision records

Decisions with a **blast radius wider than the diff that made them** — the ones a future
contributor (or a future agent) would otherwise re-derive from scratch, or quietly reverse because
the reasoning lived only in a PR thread.

One file per decision, numbered in the order they were accepted:

```
.adr/NNNN-kebab-case-title.md
```

Format is [Michael Nygard's](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions):
**Context** (the forces, including what was actually measured), **Decision** (what we do, in the
imperative), **Consequences** (what this costs, and what would justify revisiting it).

## When to write one

Write an ADR when a decision **closes off an option someone will reasonably propose again**. The
signal is that you find yourself explaining *why not* rather than *how*.

- ✅ "We manage exactly one front door" — a NetBird PR, then a Cloudflare Tunnel PR, then a ZeroTier PR
- ✅ "Polling, not an event stream" — perennial, and the reasoning isn't obvious from the code
- ❌ "Use Vitest for the web suite" — that's just what the repo does; `CLAUDE.md` covers it
- ❌ Anything already legible from the code, a test name, or a commit message

**The bar is high, and it is meant to be.** These are for the handful of decisions that shape the
system, not a record of work done. A merged PR is not an occasion for an ADR; neither is a decision
that merely took some thought, nor one you'd like on the record because it was hard-won. If a
directory of ADRs reads like a changelog, it has stopped being useful — the signal drowns, and the
few entries that genuinely close off a road get skimmed past with the rest.

Before adding one, both of these must be true:

1. **Someone has actually argued for the other road, or demonstrably will.** A real PR, a real issue,
   a proposal you had to talk someone out of. "A future contributor might wonder" is not enough — that
   is what a comment is for.
2. **The argument has nowhere better to live.** If it fits at the line that would change, put it
   there: whoever reopens the question is reading that code, not this directory. An ADR is for
   reasoning that spans files, or that argues against a road with no single line to attach to.

**Write the `Trail:` line first, and make it name the opponent.** Every ADR opens with a `Trail:`
header naming the PR, the issue or the thread where somebody argued for the other road, beside the
files the decision reaches. Write that line before the body. If you cannot fill it, condition 1 has
not been met and what you have is a header comment — put it at the line and stop. This is the whole
bar above, reduced to something answerable in the moment: 0049 has issue #243; the two candidates
turned down below had nothing to put there, and neither did the update-screen write-up that became
0044, which is the one entry in this directory no source file cites.

When in doubt, don't. A comment at the point of change costs nothing and is read by exactly the
person who needs it; an ADR that didn't need writing dilutes the ones that did. Two candidates were
turned down on this basis in one day (bundled-font laziness, and the direct-typing lifecycle) — both
became file-header comments, and both are better for it.

## Relationship to the other docs

Nothing here restates what lives elsewhere; the point is the *reasoning*, once.

| Where | What belongs there |
| --- | --- |
| [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) | The **rule** — short, normative, linking here for why |
| [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md) | How the system is **built**, as it stands today |
| [`README.md`](../README.md) | How an operator **runs** it |
| `.adr/` | Why a road **wasn't** taken |

A superseded ADR is never deleted or edited into agreement with the present. Mark it
`Superseded by NNNN` and write the new one — the wrong turn is the useful part.

A decision that is still correct but whose **scope** later changes is *amended*, not superseded: the
new ADR says what it amends, the old one gains an `Amended in scope by NNNN` pointer at the top, and
**nothing in its body is rewritten**. If you find yourself editing the argument rather than adding
the pointer, it was a supersede.

| [0031](./0031-freshness-is-a-declared-promise.md) | Freshness, focus and shape are contract promises, not adapter folklore | Accepted |
| [0032](./0032-a-worktree-is-opened-by-the-multiplexer-not-by-git.md) | A worktree is opened by the multiplexer, not by Git (addendum 2026-10-07: Herdr 0.9.3 reads the repo off `worktree.list`) | Accepted |
| [0033](./0033-the-app-face-is-a-device-preference.md) | The app's face is a device preference; an operator's fonts add to the list (differs from 0018) | Accepted |

| [0039](./0039-the-machine-says-crew-too.md) | The machine says "crew" too: protocol version 2, one release of overlap (supersedes the machine names in 0038) | Accepted |

| [0044](./0044-the-update-screen-is-one-reducer-and-one-shared-poll.md) | The update screen is one reducer and one shared poll | Amended in scope by 0064 |
| [0045](./0045-a-build-below-the-protocol-floor-is-a-red-preflight.md) | A build below the protocol floor is a red preflight, never a silent link | Accepted |
| [0046](./0046-an-urgent-patch-keeps-the-daily-cadence.md) | An urgent patch keeps the daily cadence | Accepted |
| [0047](./0047-muse-panes-render-natively.md) | Muse panes render natively: no light-theme inversion (addendum 2026-09-21: the bit's own limit) | Accepted |
| [0048](./0048-the-input-box-is-found-by-its-own-frame.md) | The input box is found by its own frame; the statusline bound only bounds what is stripped (amends 0004; addendum 2026-09-26: an indented row inside the frame is draft text) | Accepted |
| [0049](./0049-no-child-inherits-a-relocated-repository.md) | No child of Collie inherits a variable that relocates a git repository | Accepted |
| [0050](./0050-a-crew-fault-blocks-an-update-only-when-the-update-makes-it-worse.md) | A crew fault blocks an update only when the update would make it worse (distinguishes 0045) | Accepted |
| [0051](./0051-the-phone-app-runs-react-router-in-library-mode.md) | The phone app runs React Router in library mode; four build seams framework mode would take | Accepted |
| [0052](./0052-one-build-serves-any-mount.md) | One build serves any mount: `COLLIE_BASE_PATH` is a runtime setting the bridge applies when it serves the shell | Accepted |
| [0053](./0053-an-unread-dialog-still-has-a-way-out.md) | An unread dialog still has a way out: a footer phrase never silences a grammar, and a raw-only modal gets its adapter's declared cancel key (addendum 2026-09-26: positive evidence of a modal) | Accepted |
| [0054](./0054-a-printed-scale-is-tappable.md) | A printed scale is tappable: when the screen names every value the arrows move along, the card shows them all and a tap sends the delta as repeated arrow presses | Accepted |
| [0055](./0055-a-pointed-list-is-walked-then-confirmed.md) | A pointed list is walked, then confirmed: an unnumbered list with a `❯` on one row is tapped as the arrow delta plus the commit key the footer named, and never a synthesised digit (applies 0054 to a list) | Accepted |
| [0056](./0056-a-card-can-be-put-down.md) | A lifted card can be put down: every card carries a Terminal control that shows the rows it replaced, lasting only as long as that dialog | Accepted |
| [0057](./0057-the-composer-is-one-box.md) | The composer is one box: the field, the attach control and Send share one bordered container with a toolbar row, the prompt-input pattern ported by hand | Accepted |
| [0058](./0058-the-resume-picker-commits-with-enter.md) | The resume picker commits with Enter: the `/resume` session picker, recognised by its own title, search box and footer, lifts as a pointed list whose tap is the walk plus an unprinted Enter, a narrow exception to 0009 for this one dialog | Accepted |
| [0059](./0059-a-card-docks-above-the-belt.md) | A card docks above the belt: every lifted card renders in one slot outside the mirror's scroller, directly above the actions belt, capped and scrolled inside (moves where 0056's card renders) | Accepted |
| [0060](./0060-an-attachment-is-a-chip-not-a-path.md) | An attachment is a chip, not a path: an upload shows as a chip above the field and a `[Image #N]` marker in the draft, and Send swaps in the path where the marker stands | Accepted |
| [0061](./0061-the-terminal-draft-notice-floats.md) | The terminal draft notice floats: it leaves the layout for an absolute slot at the mirror's bottom edge, above the card dock or the belt, and an x hides it until that draft is gone | Accepted |
| [0062](./0062-a-crew-run-levels-to-its-target-and-its-second-step-is-not-a-new-attempt.md) | A crew run levels to its target, and its second step is not a new attempt: no turn below the target, the hourly limit exempts a step inside the same run, the lead names the limit (amends 0016) | Accepted |
| [0063](./0063-a-pane-keeps-its-place-when-its-state-changes.md) | A pane keeps its place when its state changes: no list is ordered by status, the bridge and the crew merge send place order, every surface recomputes it, and urgency is a mark plus one summary line | Amended in scope by 0070 |
| [0064](./0064-an-update-puts-the-phone-in-update-mode.md) | An update puts the phone in update mode: a locked app, a docked panel, seven steps that end only on Done, Rolled back or Stuck, the phone's own reload last and once, and a panel that never moves (amends 0044) | Accepted |
| [0065](./0065-the-changes-view-reads-git-read-only.md) | The Changes view reads git, read-only: HEAD as the base, nested repo discovery under two per-device settings, git hardened against repo-driven execution, and a diff served only for a repo and path the bridge itself listed | Accepted |
| [0066](./0066-the-dashboard-has-a-footer-panes-needs-you-changes.md) | The dashboard has a footer: Panes, Attention, Changes. Attention filters to the attention panes and never sorts, Changes lists workspaces with counts that refresh every 5 s only while the tab is on screen, the tab is kept per device (amends nothing in 0063) | Amended in scope by 0068, 0070 and 0085 |
| [0067](./0067-back-goes-up-one-level.md) | Back goes up one level: down is a push that records `from`, sideways is a replace that carries it, up steps back onto a legitimate parent or replaces onto the structural one, a cold deep link is seeded with its parents, a POP draws no slide, and sheets own no history | Accepted |
| [0068](./0068-the-second-tab-is-focus-not-attention.md) | The dashboard's second tab is Focus, not Attention: renamed for the same reason "Needs you" was, and `CircleDot` replaces `BellRing`, which read as a notification even in the quiet state (amends 0066 in scope) | Amended in scope by 0085 |
| [0069](./0069-a-row-glides-into-its-header.md) | A row glides into its header: one engine, hand-started same-document view transitions, forward on the tap and reverse only on the in-app back arrow, a crossfade when the landing isn't real, and no frozen screen because a network wait is paid before the transition starts, not during it | Accepted |
| [0070](./0070-a-pin-is-a-place-the-operator-chose.md) | A pin is a place the operator chose: pinned panes lead Panes, Focus, Changes and the switcher under the summary line, in place order, each listed once, keyed by the row and the workspace name in their own per-device store, pruned only by the operator's acts (amends 0063 and 0066 in scope) | Accepted |
| [0071](./0071-the-operator-may-ask-for-activity-order.md) | The operator may ask for activity order: place is the default, the switcher and a Settings row write one standing per-device value, activity folds the space headings into one newest-first list, and the clock is read ONCE when the list opens so no row moves under a thumb (takes up 0063's Revisit clause) | Accepted |
| [0072](./0072-a-two-pane-box-pans.md) | A two-pane box pans: a frame row carrying any COLUMN junction anchors a table run, a cross or a vertical tee, because a two-pane box draws no cross and refusing it left the box clipped rather than wrapped; a side tee is still not an anchor | Amended in scope by 0076 |
| [0073](./0073-a-live-session-is-a-bounded-window-on-the-existing-poll.md) | A live session is a bounded window on the existing poll: `GET /api/pane/:id/chat` answers what moved, a 2 MB per-session window ticks only when asked, and three positions each do one job (`gen` which numbering, `rev` when, `seq` where); no WebSocket and no seq-cursored delta | Accepted |
| [0074](./0074-a-push-title-is-a-code-the-phone-translates.md) | A push title is a code the phone translates: the bridge sends a catalogue code beside its English title, the page leaves the active language's templates in Cache Storage, and the service worker fills them, falling back to the English on any miss (amends 0030 in scope) | Accepted |
| [0075](./0075-windows-is-a-supported-host.md) | Windows is a supported host: Windows 11 x64 with Herdr only, a `windows.yml` gate, a release zip with a sha256, a `make win-rehearse` before each tag, a native Task Scheduler tier, owner-only secrets by NTFS access list, no tmux, zellij, ARM, crew membership or managed front door, and the maintainer owns the code (supersedes the contrib-only decisions on PR 71 and PR 298) | Accepted |
| [0076](./0076-the-omp-resume-picker-is-lifted-and-every-omp-modal-has-a-way-out.md) | The omp resume picker is lifted, and every omp modal has a way out: omp declares Escape as its cancel key together with positive modal evidence, its own key-hint footer naming the way out, and `/resume` lifts as a pointed list whose footer prints Enter (amends 0053's omp gap and 0072 in scope) | Amended in scope by 0077, 0078 and 0079 |
| [0077](./0077-the-omp-ask-single-select-is-lifted-and-its-multi-select-is-not.md) | The omp Ask single-select is lifted, and its multi-select is not: a one-question single-select dialog is a pointed list read off its exact four-segment footer in three keycap presets, `Other` is an option that opens the answer editor, and the multi-select keeps the Escape card because its walk-then-Space toggle has no shared recipe and its Enter changed meaning (amends 0076 in scope) | Amended in scope by 0078 |
| [0078](./0078-the-omp-tool-approval-is-lifted-and-deny-never-lands-on-approve.md) | The omp tool approval is lifted, and Deny never lands on Approve: the `bash` and `write` approval in its two captured presets is Approve, Deny and Cancel, Approve walks from the pointer while Deny always sends Down then Enter so every race ends on a denial, the card carries the whole command, or the path and all of the content, and declines rather than cut a row, and every uncaptured shape keeps the Escape card (amends 0076 and 0077 in scope) | Accepted |
| [0079](./0079-the-omp-model-picker-is-lifted-as-its-visible-window.md) | The omp model picker is lifted as its visible window: the session-only `/switch` picker is one button per model row on screen, labelled by its full id and walked from the pointer, a shortened or over-context row is never offered, the card types nothing into the search, and the modal gate accepts the picker's task-mode toggle after the way out so its declined states keep the Escape card (amends 0076 in scope) | Accepted |
| [0080](./0080-a-pointed-list-is-walked-verified-then-confirmed.md) | A pointed list is walked, verified, then confirmed: a tap on a pointed row sends the arrows bound to the tapped screen, reads again, and sends Enter only after a fresh read shows the pointer on the row, bound to that read, in the action layer for every harness (amends 0055 point 4) | Accepted |
| [0081](./0081-a-front-doors-signed-identity-is-verified-cloudflare-access-is-the-first-preset.md) | A front door's signed identity is verified, not assumed; Cloudflare Access is the first preset: with `COLLIE_ACCESS_TEAM` and `COLLIE_ACCESS_AUD` set, a request through the tunnel needs a `Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion` with this app's `aud`, the team's `iss` and a live `exp`; half a setting or unfetched keys fail closed | Accepted |
| [0082](./0082-chat-is-the-default-view-of-an-agent-pane.md) | Chat is the default view of an agent pane: the opt-in under Settings → Experiments is gone, the per-device pane view defaults to Chat and a device that chose Terminal keeps it, and the shell-to-agent handover is one sequence in which the body changes only under the cover | Accepted |
| [0083](./0083-the-files-view-reads-the-changes-root.md) | The Files view reads the Changes root: one folder or one file relative to the root the snapshot names, refused on its shape before any disk call, contained on real paths, `.git` and the bridge's state and config folders denied, one `unknown-path` answer, JSON only, and an authorised device required (`device-read`) | Accepted |
| [0084](./0084-machines-report-their-load.md) | Machines report their load: each Collie samples CPU, memory, load, network and disk on the tick it has, a member sends its last sample as the additive `machineStats` sibling of its snapshot answer, the lead or a solo Collie keeps 24 hours of minutes and one CPU, one memory and one disk rule per machine, and pushes once per episode | Accepted |
| [0085](./0085-the-dashboards-tabs-are-dashboard-crew-and-changes.md) | The dashboard's tabs are Dashboard, Crew and Changes: Focus becomes a switch in the summary line (`needsYouOnly`, per device), the first tab is renamed, Crew is drawn only while a crew is configured, a stored Focus reads as Dashboard with the switch on once (amends 0066 and 0068 in scope) | Accepted |
| [0086](./0086-reads-need-the-pairing-token.md) | Reads need the pairing token, and pairing is always on: every `/api/*` route but `/api/health` and `/api/pair` answers `403 device not paired` without a valid token, an empty registry refuses everything else, the header gate stays write-only, and the crew link and the standby door keep their own credentials (amends 0083 and 0028 in reasoning) | Accepted |
| [0087](./0087-the-on-device-store-is-one-thing.md) | The on-device store is one thing: session content the phone keeps past a page's life lives in one IndexedDB database, `collie-store`, with `fetchedAt` and the instance on every record, a 24 h default lifetime, a 256 KiB per-pane and a 10 MiB total cap, a purge on open and one wipe hook; the last-seen mirror moves there from sessionStorage | Accepted |
| [0088](./0088-paths-the-agent-prints-are-links.md) | Paths the agent prints are links, inside the Changes root only: a path in the chat, a tool card or the terminal mirror is tappable when it resolves on the phone to a path under the pane's Changes root; only that root-relative path and never `~`, an absolute path, a line suffix or a `file://` URI reaches the bridge | Accepted |
| [0089](./0089-a-second-agent-on-a-branch.md) | A second agent on a branch: a pane's ⋯ menu creates a worktree on a fresh branch and may start a `launchers.toml` row in it; the phone tags each create with a request id and the bridge keeps a receipt per id (`worktree-receipts.json`, 0600, 200 entries) so a retry replays, the launcher is matched exactly like `/api/launch`, a launcher failure is still a 200, the worktree calls get 60 s, the route is lead-local, and `trust_repository` is never sent | Accepted |
| [0090](./0090-files-shows-images.md) | Files shows pictures, as bytes typed by their own content: `files/image` beside the Files read serves a PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP or AVIF under the same root, checks and `device-read` gate, typed by magic bytes only (`415` otherwise), capped at 16 MiB (`413`), `no-store` and sandboxed; an SVG is text and is drawn from the text read in an `<img>`; the phone revokes each object URL, and a Markdown preview draws its first 20 relative pictures | Accepted |
| [0091](./0091-launch-by-id-with-a-request-id.md) | An agent is started by id, with a request id and a receipt: the bridge owns the list of agents it starts (`bridge/harness-launch.ts`, one binary word each), reports `harnesses: [{ id, label, found }]` on `GET /api/launchers` with found checked on the login shell's PATH (asked once, cached 60 s), `POST /api/launch` takes exactly one of `command`, `harness` or `shell: true` plus an optional `cwd`, and a phone-minted `requestId` replays from `launch-receipts.json` (0600, 200 entries) so a retry never opens a second pane | Accepted |
| [0092](./0092-the-keys-pad-is-a-board-you-arrange.md) | The Keys pad is a board you arrange: 7 columns, a key anchored at one cell and spanning 1 to 3 columns and 1 or 2 rows, never overlapping, a same-size drop swaps and any other overlap is refused; sticky modifiers and chord keys both come from the builder; the layout lives in the browser and is shared as a `collie-keys:2:` code (version 1 still read); the operator's Presets stay the operator's | Accepted |
| [0093](./0093-a-branch-folder-is-named-by-its-parent.md) | A branch's folder is named by its parent, and checked on every use: "Herdr's default" sends no path and the sheet shows Herdr's predicted folder; "Other folder" names a parent under home and the bridge names the child after the branch; the parent must be absolute, `..`-free as sent, a real directory under home, reached through no link, outside every dotdir and the repo, and the child must not exist; the rule runs at plan and again at create; the last choices are kept per repo in `worktree-choices.json` | Accepted |
| [0094](./0094-launchers-added-from-a-phone.md) | Launchers added from a phone live on the machine, under the operator's switches: `launchers-added.json` (0600, versioned, atomic, 20 rows, re-checked at read), never `launchers.toml`; the allowlist merges built-in ids, operator rows and the added rows the switches allow (operator wins); recipes first, free text only with `[phone] free_text`, `[phone] adds` turns phone rows off; a strict character rule; adds are writes with a request id; revoke removes the device's rows (route, CLI, read-time sweep, a crew forget); "No prompts" rows get a badge and one confirm per device; `items` gives availability and a reason per machine | Accepted |
| [0095](./0095-one-off-commands-and-their-history.md) | One-off commands and their history: `POST /api/launch` takes `{ run }`, typed into a fresh shell as a row is, after a paired device, `[phone] run` (default true), the character rule and the folder rules; never on a new branch; a run that worked joins `commands-recent.json` (0600, versioned, 12 lines, newest first, one per line, re-checked at read); `recentRuns` on `GET /api/launchers`, remove and clear as writes, forwarded per machine; a revoke leaves the history, because an entry is a line and not a grant; the audit keeps the command word and the length, never the line; a typed line is checked first (`POST /api/launch/check`, a read) so the no-prompts confirm comes before its first run | Accepted |

Numbers are claimed across **both** branches: 0011–0016 were accepted here on `v1` while `main` was
still at 0010, so a new ADR continues from the highest number in use anywhere, not the highest one on
the branch you happen to be on.
