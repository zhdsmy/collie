# Architecture decision records

Decisions with a **blast radius wider than the diff that made them** — the ones a future
contributor (or a future agent) would otherwise re-derive from scratch, or quietly reverse because
the reasoning lived only in a PR thread.

One file per decision, numbered in the order they were accepted:

```
.adr/NNNN-kebab-case-title.md
```

Format is [Michael Nygard's](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions):
**Context** (the forces, including what was actually measured), **Decision** (what we do, in the
imperative), **Consequences** (what this costs, and what would justify revisiting it).

## When to write one

Write an ADR when a decision **closes off an option someone will reasonably propose again**. The
signal is that you find yourself explaining *why not* rather than *how*.

- ✅ "We manage exactly one front door" — a NetBird PR, then a Cloudflare Tunnel PR, then a ZeroTier PR
- ✅ "Polling, not an event stream" — perennial, and the reasoning isn't obvious from the code
- ❌ "Use Vitest for the web suite" — that's just what the repo does; `CLAUDE.md` covers it
- ❌ Anything already legible from the code, a test name, or a commit message

**The bar is high, and it is meant to be.** These are for the handful of decisions that shape the
system, not a record of work done. A merged PR is not an occasion for an ADR; neither is a decision
that merely took some thought, nor one you'd like on the record because it was hard-won. If a
directory of ADRs reads like a changelog, it has stopped being useful — the signal drowns, and the
few entries that genuinely close off a road get skimmed past with the rest.

Before adding one, both of these must be true:

1. **Someone has actually argued for the other road, or demonstrably will.** A real PR, a real issue,
   a proposal you had to talk someone out of. "A future contributor might wonder" is not enough — that
   is what a comment is for.
2. **The argument has nowhere better to live.** If it fits at the line that would change, put it
   there: whoever reopens the question is reading that code, not this directory. An ADR is for
   reasoning that spans files, or that argues against a road with no single line to attach to.

When in doubt, don't. A comment at the point of change costs nothing and is read by exactly the
person who needs it; an ADR that didn't need writing dilutes the ones that did. Two candidates were
turned down on this basis in one day (bundled-font laziness, and the direct-typing lifecycle) — both
became file-header comments, and both are better for it.

## Relationship to the other docs

Nothing here restates what lives elsewhere; the point is the *reasoning*, once.

| Where | What belongs there |
| --- | --- |
| [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) | The **rule** — short, normative, linking here for why |
| [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md) | How the system is **built**, as it stands today |
| [`README.md`](../README.md) | How an operator **runs** it |
| `.adr/` | Why a road **wasn't** taken |

A superseded ADR is never deleted or edited into agreement with the present. Mark it
`Superseded by NNNN` and write the new one — the wrong turn is the useful part.

A decision that is still correct but whose **scope** later changes is *amended*, not superseded: the
new ADR says what it amends, the old one gains an `Amended in scope by NNNN` pointer at the top, and
**nothing in its body is rewritten**. If you find yourself editing the argument rather than adding
the pointer, it was a supersede.

Numbers are claimed across **both** branches: 0011–0016 were accepted here on `v1` while `main` was
still at 0010, so a new ADR continues from the highest number in use anywhere, not the highest one on
the branch you happen to be on.
