//
//   • a peer the warrant does NOT name activates a SECOND TLS ANCHOR — `deputyAnchorOf`, which is
//     what lets the deputy complete a handshake there one day;
//   • the peer the warrant DOES name activates its own DEPUTY ROLE — the standby door and the
//     takeover exchange — and anchors nothing at all, because a machine does not anchor its own
//     certificate (`transport.ts`'s `deputyAnchor` refuses exactly that case, by name).
//
// Deriving this from `deputyAnchorPem` alone therefore reported the DEPUTY — the one machine the
// whole feature is about — as "stored, NOT anchored" forever, through any number of clean restarts.
// Both roles are read here, off one clock, and the store says which one applies.

// came up holding, and a warrant that landed a minute after boot is stored without being active.

/**
 * The standby door's listener (RFC §6.2), or nothing at all.
 *
 * **`COLLIE_STANDBY_PORT` absent ⇒ nothing is bound**, and a deputy without it is a plain peer that
 * can still be taken over from a keyboard by §14's promotion. Collie BINDS this; it publishes
 * nothing — no `tailscale serve`, never `funnel`, no ownership record (ADR 0001 untouched).
 *
 * **This is its OWN listener on its OWN address (`COLLIE_STANDBY_HOST`), and that is why neither
 * loopback gate reaches it.** The bind refusal above reads `COLLIE_HOST`, and the peer-address check
 * lives in `server.ts`'s `fetch`; this door binds elsewhere and answers here. It is meant to be
 * dialled from off-box — a failover proxy is the whole point (ADR 0028) — and what admits its one
 * action is the operator's own pairing credential, not the address it arrived from. Don't route it
 * through the front door's `fetch` to "share" those gates: that would refuse the very caller it exists
 * for.
 *
 * **A LEAD with the key set binds it too, and answers only the health check.** That is not an
 * oversight in the other direction: a failover proxy's fallback backend points at THIS port
 * (RFC §14.2), so a deputy that took over and came back up as the lead would leave the proxy
 * health-checking a closed port and swinging the phone back onto the machine that died. One port,
 * one question — *should anything route here?* — and a lead answers it `200` on both of its ports.
