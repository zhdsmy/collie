//     (CLAUDE.md), so the fetch is a parameter — the `bridge/dial.ts` precedent, applied one layer up.
//     peer-client.test.ts therefore exercises the real decision logic against a fake, not a socket.

 * A healthy peer behind a Tailscale DERP relay (≈350 ms RTT, TLS handshake measured at 1.9 s) read
 * `unreachable · hello: timed out after 1200ms` forever. The arithmetic, not the peer, was the fault:
 *
 *   • Bun's `fetch` DOES pool a pinned-TLS connection, even though `tls` rides each init and this
 *     module hands it a fresh object per dial — 5 sequential dials cost 1 TCP accept, measured
 *     through a counting proxy (`harness.test.ts`, "a cold handshake priced above the budget").
 *     Bun ≥1.4 pools that dial only while its `tls` carries NO `checkServerIdentity` callback, which
 *     is why `dialTls` pins the name via the certificate's own SAN instead — mechanism in
 *     `transport.ts`. Everything below assumes pooling holds; break it and the deadlock returns.
 *   • But an ABORTED attempt leaves no pooled connection behind. So when the cold handshake alone
 *     costs more than the whole per-request budget, every attempt aborts mid-handshake, the next one
 *     starts cold again, and the link never bootstraps. Four attempts, four accepts, four timeouts.
 *   • One patient call breaks the deadlock: it completes the handshake, and every strict-budget
 *     request after it rides the warm connection at one RTT.
 *
 * So the verdict gets its own budget and the poll keeps the strict one. A data request that misses
 * {@link packTimeoutBudget} still means "stale this poll" — never "peer gone" — and the probe that
 * decides "gone" is allowed to pay for a handshake. Clamping it to the poll fraction would restore
 * the deadlock, which is precisely why it is not clamped.
 *
 * It is floored at the data budget so an operator cannot make the verdict MORE impatient than the
 * poll it is meant to outlast.

// ── The bootstrap credit ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The patient budget above fixed the VERDICT and left the DATA path in the same deadlock it was
// measured out of (2026-08-19, against a real DERP-relayed peer): hello cold 1.86 s → 200, snapshot
// cold **with the handshake** 1.22 s → 200, snapshot warm 0.12 s. Every data request carried the
// strict ~1200 ms budget, so a cold one aborted mid-handshake; an aborted attempt pools nothing, so
// the next one started cold as well, and the peer read `unreachable` with every pane read answering
// 503 after exactly one budget, forever.
//
// So a data request gets ONE patient attempt per cold link — the same medicine as `hello`, bounded so
// it can never become the steady-state budget:
//
//   • WARM (a dial reached the far side and nothing has failed since) ⇒ the strict budget, always.
//     Warm requests measured 0.11–0.12 s, so the strict budget is not what is broken.
//   • COLD with its credit unspent ⇒ the patient budget, and the credit is spent AT ISSUE. Concurrent
//     requests and later polls therefore do not stack patient dials: at most one is ever in flight.
//   • COLD with its credit spent ⇒ the strict budget. A host that is genuinely gone fails in one
//     strict budget per poll, which is the pre-existing behaviour and the point of the bound.
//   • A warm link that fails is granted a fresh credit, because that is exactly the shape of a pool
//     the far side (or an idle timer) tore down: one strict miss, then one patient re-bootstrap.
//
// It is deliberately small, pure and exported so `peer-client.test.ts` can pin the matrix without a
// socket. Only a DATA dial spends a credit — `hello` already carries the patient budget of its own.
