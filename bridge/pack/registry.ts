// and it is written so the *shape* of the rule is visibly identical rather than merely similar.
//
// ── THE RULE THIS MODULE EXISTS TO KEEP ──────────────────────────────────────
// `bridge/sessions.ts:17-20` says a client-supplied session name is ONLY ever a Map key: it never
// becomes a filesystem path. The host carries the same rule plus one more, because a host names a
// *machine*:
//
//     A client-supplied host is only ever a registry key. It never becomes a path, and it never
//     becomes an address the lead dials.
//
// An address comes from the trust store or from nowhere: {@link PackRegistry.resolve} looks a host up
// among enrolled members and returns the member record, whose `address` the operator supplied at
// enrollment time. There is deliberately NO code path in this file from a URL parameter to a URL the
// client dials — a host that is not in the roster produces `undefined`, which the caller turns into
// the same 404 an unknown session gets today, and nothing is attempted.

   * "the response arrived here" meaning (§10.2 — freshness is the lead's receipt time).

   * **Two rules keep this from becoming a second classifier:**

   *     revived by a lucky proxy: that verdict is the sweep's and the probe's (§10.4), and it clears
   *     on the next tick anyway.
   *   • **`lastSeenAt` only ever moves forward.** Forwards are concurrent by nature — several pane
   *     reads can be in flight at once and may land out of order — so an older receipt must never
   *     overwrite a newer one.
   *
