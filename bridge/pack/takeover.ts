// The takeover exchange (RFC §7, PACK_PROTOCOL.md §18.16): the one thing that SPENDS a warrant.
//
// ── THREE STEPS, AND THE ORDER IS THE SAFETY ─────────────────────────────────
//   (a) **Ask the lead first.** One patient `hello`. If it answers, the takeover is REFUSED and
//       nothing anywhere has changed — not a byte, not a store, not a pin.
//   (b) **Ask the peers, twice.** A `probe` round that changes nothing anywhere, then a `commit`
//       round. **Any peer answering `lead_is_alive` aborts the whole thing**, before the deputy has
//       written anything. That is the partition defence and it is why the exchange is two-phase: a
//       peer its lead dialled two seconds ago is direct evidence that the deputy's silence is the
//       DEPUTY's own network problem.
//   (c) **Commit locally, last.** Only after the reachable peers have re-pinned does this machine
//       rewrite its own store as a lead's.
//
// **This is not a vote.** No peer is asked what it thinks should happen; each is asked one factual
// question about its own inbox (`lastDialledAt`, RFC §10.1), and one honest *no* is decisive. A
// two-machine pack has no witness, is allowed anyway, and the page says so (RFC §16, decision 8) —
// there, step (a) is the whole evidence base and the operator is the quorum (ADR 0026).
//
// **Partial success is representable and is not a failure.** A peer unreachable during (b) is carried
// on the new lead as `rePinPending` and reconciled by RFC §9 automatically, on the new lead's own
// sweep, with no operator step. A peer that answered `lead_is_alive` is not partial; it is an abort.
//
// PURE except for the injected dials and the injected commit — every decision below is a function of
// data, which is what makes the refusal matrix a table test rather than a test of a socket.

 * a store saying `lead` under a peer's still-pinned listener is a machine nobody can reach.
 *
 * **A live drill found the zero.** `Restart=on-failure` — systemd's common choice and the one the
 * drill's unit carried — treats a clean `0` as "this service is finished" and does **not** revive it.
 * The result is the worst state this feature can produce: the store says `lead`, the service is
 * `inactive`, and the operator holding the phone has no shell to fix it with. `Restart=always` and
 * `Restart=on-failure` both revive a NON-ZERO exit, so a non-zero status is the only one that is
 * correct under either policy — and the takeover answer's "reload in a moment" is only honest with it.

/**
 * The TLS material ONE takeover dial carries — or `undefined`, which is a dial that pins nothing.
 *
 * A deputy is a peer: it holds exactly one roster entry of its own (its lead) plus the roster that
 * rode the warrant push (RFC §7.4), and it reaches both kinds from here. The two kinds are not
 * dialled the same way.
 *
 *   • A **WITNESS** — any row of `standbyRoster` — is pinned to the certificate that row carries.
 *     A peer's listener enforces its own pin (§8.1), so the certificate on the wire really is that
 *     member's and the anchor really can match.
 *   • The **LEAD** is dialled with no TLS material at all. `bridge/pack/transport.ts`'s design note
 *     states the law: "A LEAD does not pin its listener at all. Its pack surface rides the front
 *     door, and `tailscale serve` (or any conforming proxy, docs/deployment.md Variant C) terminates TLS
 *     before the process sees the connection — no client certificate can survive to it under ANY
 *     design." So the certificate a takeover meets in the deputy→lead direction is the front door's,
 *     never the lead's own, and `ca: [lead.certPem]` could not match at any address a lead can
 *     publish. Same bug class as F10, fixed for the CLI's dials in `b126989`, and keyed the same
 *     way: on the roster's LEAD ENTRY, never on the shape of its address. An address is an
 *     operator-owned hint (§4), so a lead at a bare `host:port` is still a lead whose listener pins
 *     nothing, and a witness behind the operator's own TLS proxy is still a peer whose listener
 *     demands the pin.
 *
 * **Why it matters more here than anywhere else.** The lead dial is step (a) — the one patient
 * `hello` whose ANSWER refuses the takeover. A pin that can never match makes every lead look dead,
 * and a two-machine pack has no witness to catch it (RFC §16, decision 8): the crown would be taken
 * from a lead that was answering the whole time. Takeover is exactly the moment this path must work.
 *
 * The second factor is relocated, not lost. The takeover client signs no request BODY (it is in
 * nobody's roster, so a §8.6 body signature could only fail to verify), but the pack secret and the
 * dial attestation ride every call `PeerClient` makes — see `takeoverClient` in `bridge/index.ts`.
 *
 * An unknown member — one in neither place — also pins nothing, which is the shape this had before
 * and the only honest answer: there is no certificate to anchor.
