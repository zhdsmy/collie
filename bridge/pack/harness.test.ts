// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// THE TWO-INSTANCE INTEGRATION HARNESS (spec M4/08).
//
// Two REAL Collie bridges, as child processes, on loopback, enrolled through the REAL enrollment
// path, talking over REAL pinned mutual TLS with certificates this build minted. Nothing about the
// pack is faked: not the handshake, not the trust store, not the HTTP, not the admission gate.
//
// ── WHY IT IS A `bun test` FILE AND NOT A SHELL SCRIPT ───────────────────────
// CLAUDE.md's rule is that `Bun.serve`-dependent code stays out of `bun test`, because Vitest-on-Node
// cannot run it. The backend suite is Bun's OWN runner, which can — the constraint was never about
// this side. Keeping the harness here buys the thing a shell script could not: the operator verbs are
// invoked as the FUNCTIONS `cli/pack.ts` exports, with `PackDeps` supplied by the harness. So
// `restart()` is a real respawn of a real child process (which is what a membership change must
// trigger, and what re-pins the listener), `serve()`/`unserve()` are no-ops that touch no tailnet,
// and nothing in this file can reach the machine it runs on.
//
// ── WHAT IS FAKED, AND WHY IT IS HONEST ──────────────────────────────────────
// Exactly one thing: Herdr. `fake-herdr.ts` answers the handful of methods a snapshot and a pane read
// need, over a real unix socket, one-shot as the real server is. The subject here is the pack
// transport; standing up a second project's daemon to reach it would make this test depend on a
// machine that has one, which is the definition of the flaky test the spec says will be deleted.
//
// ── SAFETY ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Every instance is ephemeral: a fresh `stateDir` and config root under `mkdtemp`, a port the OS
// chose, a scratch `HOME`. Nothing reads or writes the developer's own Collie, and no verb that
// touches the world (`tailscale`, `systemctl`) is reachable — `exec` is a fake that finds nothing.

//
// Two facts about Bun 1.3.14 underwrite the ENTIRE application-layer half of the pack's first factor:
//   1. `Bun.serve` verifies a pinned client certificate at the handshake but exposes NO per-request
//      accessor for the certificate that was presented. That is why identity is attested to the
//      admission gate as a boolean (`transportPinned`, bridge/pack/transport.ts) instead of read, and
//      why peer→lead requests must re-establish the second factor with a signature (§8.6, signing.ts).
//   2. `server.reload({ tls })` does NOT swap the enforced `ca`. That is why there is no live re-pin and
//      why every membership verb restarts the bridge to change its anchors (`applyLocally`, cli/pack.ts).
//
// If EITHER premise breaks in a future Bun, the workaround it justifies should be DISMANTLED, not
// silently fossilised. These probes stand up a minimal real `Bun.serve` over mutual TLS with certs this
// build mints, and assert the CURRENT limitation still holds — so they PASS today and FAIL loudly the
// day Bun gains the capability, pointing the next engineer at transport.ts / signing.ts / §8.6.
