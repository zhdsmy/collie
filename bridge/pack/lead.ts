// nothing: it exposes {@link PackLead.sweep}, and `bridge/index.ts` calls it from the primary
// session's poll tick (`StateEngine.onTick`). Search this file for `setInterval`/`setTimeout` — the
// absence is the feature, and `lead.test.ts` pins it by asserting a constructed lead makes no call
// until something calls `sweep()`.
//
// The one thing that IS stateful here is what the registry cannot hold: the last-good BODY. Health
// (`reachable`/`lastSeenAt`/reason) lives in `PackRegistry` and only there, so there is still exactly
// one owner of "what the lead believes about peer X"; this class adds "and here is the last thing it
// said", which is what makes §10.2's *a peer's sessions never vanish* mechanical rather than
// aspirational.

/**
 * How long the lead waits before re-probing a member whose protocol it cannot speak (§10.2:
 * "no (probed on a slow backoff)"). The last entry repeats forever — the `bridge/event-poker.ts`
 * backoff convention.
 *
 * **Why a version skew is not retried on the cadence:** it cannot resolve on its own. A peer speaks
 * a different protocol until somebody updates a build, which is minutes-to-days away, so polling it
 * at 1.5 s would be N pointless round trips per second for an outcome that is already known and
 * already rendered. Unreachable is the opposite — a cable, a sleep, a restart — and stays on the
