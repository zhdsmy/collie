// literal at all**: a solo instance's route table is asserted, by reading server.ts's source, to be
// exactly today's (`bridge/solo-baseline.test.ts` §4, including `not.toMatch(/"\/pack/)`). Keeping
// the prefix here means solo does not merely *skip* the pack routes — it never registers them, and
// the baseline can prove it by grepping the file that does the registering.
//
// server.ts takes an OPTIONAL handler and calls it before anything else; index.ts supplies one only
// when a trust store exists. With no trust store there is no handler, so `/pack/v1/anything` falls

// that had never heard of federation.

// here is dispatch, body parsing and response assembly, thin enough to review by eye (the
// testability constraint in CLAUDE.md — but note this handler takes a plain `Request` and needs no
// `Bun.serve`, so router.test.ts does exercise it for real).

   *      collie's own (`isDepositionProof`);
   *   3. it must verify against **this collie's own certificate**. A lead can verify its own
   *      signature, and that is the whole reason the warrant is signed by the lead rather than
   *      attested by the claimant: what deposes a machine is its own past consent handed back to it,
   *      never a conclusion it drew or a claim it chose to believe (ADR 0026's rule 3);
   *   4. the self-heal resolves the new lead out of this collie's **own roster** and refuses if the
   *      fingerprint does not match a certificate it already pinned — so no trust is created here.
   *
