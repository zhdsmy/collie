// Every forwarded route goes through {@link forwardToPeer}. There is deliberately no per-route
// federation branch: `reply` does not know it can be remote, `upload` has no peer variant, and
// `history` does not gain a host parameter. Route matching stays exactly where it was in server.ts;
// this module is reached from the ONE place that resolves `(host, session)`.
//
// ── WHAT MAKES IT A PROXY AND NOT A RE-IMPLEMENTATION ────────────────────────
// The lead does not parse a forwarded body, does not recompute an ETag, does not touch a disk on a
// peer's behalf, and does not interpret a send/verify sequence (.adr/0010 lives client-side and on
// the OWNING host — §9.1). Everything here is request-shaping in, response-classification out; the
// transport is the injected peer client, so all of it is unit-testable without a socket.
//
// ── AND THE ONE THING IT REFUSES TO GUESS ────────────────────────────────────
// §10.3: an attempted write whose outcome is unknown is SURFACED, never retried and never reported
// as success. A pack link is `.adr/0010`'s problem over a lossier wire — a retry types the bytes into
// a real terminal twice.

 *
 * The pane id is carried through **verbatim, still percent-encoded**: it is a Herdr pane id on the

 *
 * - `if-none-match` — passed through so the peer can answer its own `304` (§9.1).
 * - `x-collie-seen` — the seen semantics travel unchanged, so "seen" is recorded ONCE, by the owning
 *   host's own ledger (.adr/0003). The lead marks nothing for a pane it does not own.
 * - `content-type` — carries the multipart boundary an upload cannot be re-assembled without (§13).
 *
 * **`accept-encoding: identity` is SET here, and the phone's own value is never forwarded.** The lead
 * asks the peer for identity bytes, so the body it holds and the body it re-emits are the same bytes.
 * Compression is **hop-local** (.adr/0023): this hop is plain, and {@link proxiedResponse} compresses
 * the lead→phone hop itself, on the phone's own `accept-encoding`.
 *
 * Omitting the header is NOT enough, which is what this comment used to claim: Bun's `fetch` supplies
 * its own `accept-encoding: gzip, deflate, br, zstd` when the init carries none, so the peer gzips,
 * `fetch` transparently decompresses — and, unlike the spec's step, does **not** strip
 * `content-encoding: gzip` from the response headers. The lead then re-emitted a `gzip` header over
 * plain bytes and every peer pane rendered as "(no recent output)", because the phone's `fetch` threw
 * trying to inflate them. Setting `identity` explicitly (Bun passes it through unmodified) makes the
 * peer hop genuinely uncompressed; {@link PROXIED_RESPONSE_HEADERS} not carrying the peer's
 * `content-encoding` is the belt to this braces. The ETag is unaffected either way — it is hashed over
 * the pre-gzip body (`bridge/http-cache.ts`) — so what this costs is one tailnet hop's compression,
 * and what it buys is a header that describes the bytes.
 *
 * `X-Pack-Device` is added here rather than on the client because it is a property of the PHONE's
 * request — the operator's device as the lead's own `deviceAuth()` resolved it (§12) — and the sweep
 * that polls a peer's snapshot has no phone behind it. Absent when the lead's device gate is off,

 * chunk by chunk rather than held whole. The peer's ETag rides through untouched — it names the
 * identity bytes, exactly as `gzipJsonResponse` intends it on a local route (.adr/0023).
 *
 * `content-length` is absent by construction in both branches: it is not copied, and a transform
 * cannot know it. A copied one would be the peer's pre-decompression length — the same lie as a
 * copied `content-encoding`, in a field the phone trusts even harder.
 *
 * A `304`/`204` carries no body at all, which the platform enforces, so neither can be compressed.
