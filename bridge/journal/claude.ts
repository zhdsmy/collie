// Claude Code's journal adapter.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. A pane running Claude sits on the terminal's ALTERNATE SCREEN, and the alternate
// screen has no scrollback ring — Herdr's terminal core (Ghostty) keeps nothing behind the viewport.
// Empirically: every claude pane reports `scroll.max_offset_from_bottom: 0`, and `pane.read` returns
// exactly `viewport_rows + 1` lines no matter how many you ask for (200, 600, 5000, 10000 — all 52).
// A plain bash pane on the primary screen, by contrast, reports 6895 and pages fine. So "load older"
// against a Claude pane can never work: the bytes were never retained. This is upstream terminal
// behaviour, not a Collie bug and not a config knob.
//
// The history does exist, though — Claude Code writes every turn to its own session log at
// `~/.claude/projects/<mangled-cwd>/<session-uuid>.jsonl`, and Herdr hands us that uuid on the pane
// record (`agent_session.value`, kind `id`). It is strictly BETTER than terminal scrollback would
// have been: real message boundaries, timestamps, tool calls folded together with their results, and
// it survives the pane being closed.
//
// SHAPE OF THE SOURCE (verified against Claude Code 2.1.220, 2026-07-26):
//   {"type":"user",      "message":{"role":"user","content":"..." | [ {type:"tool_result",...} ]}, ...}
//   {"type":"assistant", "message":{"role":"assistant","content":[ {type:"text"|"thinking"|"tool_use"} ]}}
//   plus bookkeeping rows we ignore (mode, permission-mode, ai-title, file-history-*, queue-operation…).
// Human turns carry a STRING content; a `user` row whose content is a LIST is tool-result traffic,
// not something the user typed — we fold those into the tool call that produced them rather than
// rendering 705 fake "user" turns. `isSidechain` marks subagent traffic (dropped by default);
// `isCompactSummary` marks the summary Claude writes when a session is compacted.
