// The row reducer: the shape every adapter's parser takes so that a live session which gains one row
// costs one row of work.
//
// ── WHY ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `parse(text)` reads a whole file. On the real sessions measured on 2026-09-29 that is 186.8 MB,
// 89.8 MB and 64.9 MB, and `files.ts`'s `MAX_TRANSCRIPT_BYTES` already clamps a read to the last
// 32 MB — which `TranscriptStore` then re-reads and re-parses on every mtime move. One new row
// therefore costs 32 MB of reading and a full re-parse of it. That is the cost this module removes.
//
// ── THE ONE FACT THE WHOLE DESIGN RESTS ON ───────────────────────────────────
// A raw `\n` byte is always a row boundary, in all six formats. The three file harnesses write JSONL,
// and the two SQLite harnesses serialise their rows through `JSON.stringify`, which escapes a newline
// inside a string value as `\n` (two characters) and never emits a raw one. So a reader may cut the
// byte stream anywhere: a fragment either completes with the next chunk or is a fragment of exactly
// one row. Nothing has to understand JSON to find the boundaries.
//
// ── WHAT A REDUCER REPORTS, AND WHY IT IS TWO LISTS ──────────────────────────
// A tool result lands in a LATER row than its call, and folding it in mutates a part inside a turn
// that was emitted already. Under `parse(text)` that is invisible: the caller only ever sees the
// finished array. Under a tail the caller is holding that turn on a screen, so the reducer has to
// say which of its earlier answers changed. Hence `changed` beside `added`.
//
// It is one `uuid` list rather than a pair of "replace" verbs because a `uuid` is the identity and
// the caller already holds the object. A reducer mutates the part in place, exactly as the whole-file
// loop always did, and names the turn it happened in.

  /** Turns that did not exist before this row, oldest first. */
  readonly added: readonly TranscriptEntry[];
  /** `uuid`s of turns emitted EARLIER that this row changed in place. Never a position. */
  readonly changed: readonly string[];
}

// ── WHAT A REDUCER REPORTS ABOUT WHAT IT COULD NOT READ, AND WHY IT IS A METHOD ──
// A vendor's format drifts by GAINING a type, not by changing a known one: a row kind nobody has
// looked at, or a content block nobody has looked at. Every reducer here drops both silently, and it
// has to — a tail read must tolerate a blank line, a JSON fragment and a row of an unknown shape
// without throwing. So the code that keeps a screen honest is also the code that hides a format
// change. Nothing in the tree notices until somebody reads a card that looks wrong.
//
// A reducer therefore COUNTS what it had no branch for, by name, and the count is asked for with a
// METHOD rather than answered on {@link Reduction}:
//
//   * The question is about the SESSION, not about one row. "Which types did this log show that we
//     cannot read" has one answer per session, and a field on `Reduction` would make every caller
//     accumulate state the reducer already keeps.
//   * `Reduction` is the hot path. `NO_CHANGE` is one frozen object handed back from some forty
//     early returns; giving it a tally means an allocation per row for an answer almost nobody reads.
//   * It is REQUIRED, exactly as `JournalAdapter.reducer()` is required (ADR 0073 §8). Optional would
//     mean every caller writing `reducer.unknowns?.()` behind a fallback that reads "nothing
//     unknown" — the one wrong default for a gate that fails above zero.
//
// KNOWN MEANS "MET AND DECIDED ABOUT", NEVER "RENDERED". A type an adapter drops on purpose is known
// — the drop is the decision — and that is what keeps the tally to one meaning: a name nobody has
// looked at yet. Where a known list holds a type this reducer drops and arguably should not, the
// comment beside it says so. A gap with a name is not drift.
//
// The caller is `scripts/harness-canary/journal.ts`: it reads the canary's OWN session per harness,
// fails the run when the count is above zero, and names the type. Nothing on the live path asks —
// `journal/live.ts` neither calls this nor pays for it.
