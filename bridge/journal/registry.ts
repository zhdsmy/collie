// The journal registry — the SINGLE decision site for "which agents have a readable history".
//
// Maps a Herdr snapshot `agent` string to its JournalAdapter; anything absent from the map has no
// journal, which the history route reports as an ordinary `no-session` rather than an error. Adding a
// harness is a one-line change to the list below plus its adapter module — never a new branch in the
// route or the store.
//
// This deliberately mirrors `web/src/lib/harness/registry.ts`, but the two are NOT the same seam and
// must not be conflated: the frontend harness registry owns block grammars and the send guard for the
// LIVE MIRROR; this one owns reading an on-disk log. A harness can plausibly have one without the
// other.

 * A harness gets a LIST because one machine can hold several of its homes — `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` per
 * profile is the case that forced it (issue #92), and every other harness has the same shape of
 * setting. Roots are searched in order and the first holding the session wins; session ids are
 * globally unique, so that is a lookup, not a guess. A single root is simply a one-element list, and
 * an adapter still accepts a bare string so one-root callers read unchanged.
