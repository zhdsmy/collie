// ── SECRETS ARE MASKED BEFORE A TURN LEAVES THE BRIDGE ─────────────────────────────────────────
// The journal's own text: what the agent said, what it thought, what a tool printed, the command it
// ran, the diff it wrote, and the question it asked with its options and the answers. Each string
// goes through `bridge/redact.ts`, the same list the mirror and the push use, so a key masked on the
// screen is masked in Chat too. Line count and block order hold: the mask is the same length as what
// it hides, and no part, turn or hunk line is added or dropped.
//
// THE MASK IS STRUCTURAL, NOT A FIELD LIST. A tool part is walked whole, its `call` included, and
// EVERY string in it is masked unless its key is in {@link UNMASKED_KEYS}. Until 1.18.0 this was a
// switch that named the content fields per call kind, and the `question` kind's words (each question,
// header, option label and description, and the answers) went out in clear because nobody named them.
// A field added to `ToolCall` or to the tool part later is masked from its first day, with no edit
// here: forgetting to list a field now leaves an address masked, which is visible and harmless,
// never a secret in clear. `text.test.ts` pins every field of every call kind.
//
// Three keys are skipped, because they are labels the bridge itself wrote, never an agent's words:
// `kind`, `id` and `mimeType`. Everything else is masked BY SHAPE, paths included (`path`, `to`, a
// search's `where`) and image URLs too: the mask replaces only the known secret shapes in
// `bridge/redact.ts`, so an ordinary path or URL comes back unchanged, and a path that does hold a
// key is masked like any other text. A masked path then simply does not link on the phone (its
// `files/exist` check asks for the masked string and finds nothing), which is the price and an
// acceptable one. An image URL in one of the two shapes `resolveImageUrl` (journal/pi.ts) produces,
// `/api/blobs/<64 hex>` or a `data:image/*;base64,` payload, is left whole: neither shape can hold a
// secret in text, a blob's hash must stay the hash the blob route answers to, and a vendor-key shape
// can turn up by chance inside megabytes of base64 and would break the picture. Any other image URL
// is masked by shape. The entry's own `uuid`, `ts` and `role` are never walked. Numbers and flags
// are not strings and pass as they are.
//
// Called by the History and Chat routes (server.ts) when `COLLIE_REDACT` is on, and by a crew lead
// on a member's History and Chat answers (bridge/answer-mask.ts, crew/mask.ts). Never on what the
// operator sends, and never on the audit trail.
