// SHAPE OF THE SOURCE (verified against on-disk rollouts from codex 0.32.0 AND 0.145.0, 2026-07-29 —
// the path layout and the row envelope are identical across that span; 0.145 adds `world_state` and
// `turn_context` row types, and a `developer` message role, all of which this parser ignores):
//   ~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-<ISO-ts>-<session-uuid>.jsonl
//   {"timestamp":"…","type":"session_meta","payload":{"id":"<uuid>","cwd":"…","cli_version":"…"}}
//   {"timestamp":"…","type":"response_item","payload":{"type":"message"|"reasoning"|
//                                                      "function_call"|"function_call_output", …}}

//                                                  "agent_reasoning"|"token_count", …}}
// `{timestamp,type,payload}` are the ONLY top-level keys.
//
// THE TRAP: ROWS ARE DOUBLE-BOOKED. The same conversation is written twice — once as `response_item`
// (the API-shaped record) and once as `event_msg` (the UI event stream). Measured on one session: 29
// `response_item` user messages against 28 `event_msg` user_messages, and the same for assistant
// turns. Parse both families and every turn renders twice. We take `response_item` and drop
// `event_msg` wholesale, because only `response_item` carries tool RESULTS
// (`function_call_output`) — the event stream has the calls' narration but not their output.
//
// Where Herdr's id comes from: Codex's `SessionStart` hook reports `session_id` to
// `pane.report_agent_session` (herdr integration `codex`, version 6), so the pane record carries a
// kind-`id` ref exactly like Claude's. It needs `herdr integration install codex`; without the hook
// there is no id and the journal correctly reports "no-session".

/**
 * A stable per-row cursor, synthesised because Codex rows carry NO id of their own — and
 * `TranscriptEntry.uuid` is the paging cursor (`?before=`).
 *
 * Row POSITION is the obvious candidate and the wrong one: a log over the byte cap is tail-read, so
 * the window's first row is not the file's first row, and the offset moves as the file grows. Hashing
 * the row's own bytes instead makes the cursor a property of the CONTENT, so it survives a window
 * that starts somewhere else. The occurrence counter disambiguates rows that are byte-identical
 * (two identical shell calls); an unknown cursor degrades to "newest" rather than to an empty page,
 * so the rare miss is a re-render, never a dead end.
 *
 * KNOWN FAILURE MODE, accepted. If a >32 MB log's tail window shifts between two requests AND an
 * earlier byte-identical row falls out of it, the occurrence counters renumber: a cursor the client
 * holds as `cx-<h>-2` can then name what used to be `cx-<h>-3`. That pages to a slightly wrong
 * position rather than degrading to "newest" — the one case where the miss is silent. It needs a
 * multi-megabyte log, duplicate rows identical to the byte, and a window shift between two taps; the
 * harm is a misplaced page in a view you scroll anyway, so it isn't worth a per-row index the format
 * doesn't give us.
 *
 * INVARIANT this relies on: `seen` is advanced for every `response_item` row, INCLUDING rows that
 * emit no entry (a tool output that folds onto its call, an empty reasoning row). Numbering must be a
 * function of the parsed window alone — if it depended on which rows happened to render, adding a
 * renderable row would renumber the ones before it.

 * whole year. The hit is cached; a cached path is re-verified before use, since a session can be
 * deleted while the bridge is up.
 *
 * No continuation-following, deliberately: Codex reports its session on the `SessionStart` hook, so a

// `last_token_usage` is the TURN. `total_token_usage` is a running total that reaches millions and
// would read as permanently warm, so it is never read. And `turn_context` is written once per turn
// while `token_count` fires many times, so the model can sit much further back than the newest counts
// — which is why the window is 128 KB and not smaller: a shorter tail finds the tokens and loses the
// model, silently demoting every GPT-5.6 session to the five-minute rule.
//
// Codex publishes nothing that names its TTL outright, so unlike Claude there is no `observedTtl`
// here. The model is what the rule is picked by (`bridge/cache/rules/index.ts` § modelRuleFor).
