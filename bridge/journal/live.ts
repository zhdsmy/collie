// The live window: what a screen watching a working session asks every poll, and the bounded thing
// the bridge holds so that asking costs the change rather than the session.
//
// ── THE SHAPE OF THE ANSWER, AND WHY IT IS THREE NUMBERS ─────────────────────
// A window answers `{ gen, rev, head, oldest, hasOlder, upserts }`. Three of those are positions and
// each does ONE job, which is why none of them can be merged into another:
//
//  - `gen`  — WHICH NUMBERING. It changes when the window rebuilt from a fresh tail read, which
//             renumbers everything. A client holding another `gen` must replace what it holds; there
//             is no way to merge two numberings, and pretending otherwise is how a thread ends up
//             with one turn drawn twice.
//  - `rev`  — WHEN. It moves once per tick that produced anything, and every entry carries the `rev`
//             it was last touched at. `upserts` is "every entry newer than the `rev` you hold".
//  - `seq`  — WHERE. A turn's place in the thread, assigned once and never reassigned. An entry that
//             changes in place is the same item at the same `seq`.
//
// **`rev` is the field spec 08 sketched as `seq`, and the sketch was wrong.** A tool result lands in a
// later row than its call and edits a turn that went out long ago, so "what is new" cannot be read off
// a position watermark: the turn that changed sits BELOW the watermark, and a `seq`-cursored answer
// would never mention it. One number cannot be both the place a turn sits and the moment it last
// moved. Splitting them is what makes `upserts` a single list keyed by `uuid` — the spec's own
// requirement — instead of a "replace" verb the wire does not have.
//
// ── WHAT IS BOUNDED, AND WHAT THAT COSTS ────────────────────────────────────
// The sessions measured on 2026-09-29 were 186.8 MB, 89.8 MB and 64.9 MB. A window holds at most
// {@link MAX_LIVE_BYTES} of composed turns and {@link MAX_LIVE_ENTRIES} of them, whichever bites
// first, and it trims from the OLD end. So a session of any size costs the same memory, and the turns
// that fall off the front are not lost: they are the History read's job (`store.ts`), reached through
// `?before=`, and `hasOlder` is how a client knows to offer it.
//
// ── NO READER MEANS NO WORK ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
// There is no timer in this file. A tick happens because somebody asked, with a floor of
// {@link TICK_FLOOR_MS} so several readers of one session share one read, and a window nobody has
// asked about for {@link WINDOW_IDLE_MS} is dropped whole. That is the rule `use-polling.ts` already
// follows on the other side of the wire, restated on this one.

   * bridge nobody is watching must cost nothing, and a sweep that fires whether or not anybody asked
   * is a cost. The `Map` is insertion-ordered and every ask re-inserts, so "oldest asked" is simply
   * the first key.
