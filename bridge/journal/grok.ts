//   {"type":"system","content":"…"}                          ← dropped

// User speech is wrapped in `<user_query>…</user_query>` inside a content list. The same `user`
// type also carries injected plumbing (`user_info`, skills lists, MCP banners) — those rows have
// no `prompt_index` and no user_query tag, and rendering them as "You" would dump the system prompt
// onto the phone. We only keep a user row that yields a user_query (or is otherwise a prompt_index
// turn whose text we can extract).
//
// Reasoning rows carry a short summary AND an encrypted blob. The blob never leaves the disk; we
// take the summary as a `thinking` part on the following assistant turn.
//
// Where Herdr's id comes from: the grok integration reports `session_id` (kind `id`) matching the
// session directory name — a UUID, v7 observed. It needs `herdr integration install grok`.
