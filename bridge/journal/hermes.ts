// hermes rows cannot share an id, so there is no same-value row to lose.
//
// WHAT THIS CURSOR CANNOT SEE, stated rather than papered over. A hermes row is NOT frozen once
// written: `active`, `compacted` and `display_kind` are mutable per-row state, and both the query
// above and `rowEntry` read them. So a turn can change, or stop being composed at all, WITHOUT its id
// moving — and an id cursor is blind to both. `Reduction` has no `removed` and should not grow one: a
// reader going forward cannot know a row vanished. That is the live window's business, and its verb
// for it is a reset. This method's duty is to be honest about the hole, not to invent a fix for it
// one layer too low.
//
// ORDER, AND ITS ONE KNOWN LIMIT. A live read orders by `m.id` alone, where the whole-session read
// orders by `lineage.depth desc, m.id`. Inside a window bounded by id the two agree, because an
// ancestor's rows were all written before the child session existed and therefore carry lower ids.
// The exception is an ancestor that gains a row AFTER the fork: its low id is already behind the
// cursor, so a live read never sees it. It arrives on the next reset. A fork whose parent is still
// being written to is not a session shape hermes produces today.

 * type on it anywhere — there is no content discriminator Hermes could add a value to. So this
 * reducer's part tally is always empty, and that is the format speaking.

 * is one turn: `rowEntry` reads that row and nothing else, and Hermes writes a tool RESULT as its own
 * row, which this adapter renders as its own `note` entry rather than folding onto the assistant turn
 * that made the call (`rowEntry`, the `role === "tool"` branch). The two are paired by the id the
 * result repeats in `tool_call_id`, carried on the part for a VIEW to match up; the adapter never
 * reaches back. So no row can alter a turn `push` already handed over, and it can never need to
 * report a `changed` uuid. Claude and pi both need one; this format gives them nothing to attach to.
 *
 * WHAT MOVES INSTEAD — the fact a live window has to be designed against. Within ONE composition each
 * id appears exactly once: `messages.id` is an INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, so even the lineage walk in
 * `composeLines`, which pulls a parent session's rows in as well, brings rows with ids of their own.
 * But a row is not frozen once written. `active`, `compacted` and `display_kind` are mutable per-row
 * state, and both the query (`active = 1 or compacted = 1`) and `rowEntry` read them — so the NEXT
 * composition of the same session may carry the same id again, may carry it rendering differently, or
 * may not carry it at all. A reducer fed those successive compositions emits such a line twice, BOTH
 * TIMES AS `added`, because it keeps no memory of what it has seen. A caller holding the first copy
 * must replace by `uuid` rather than append, and a turn a later read stops producing is something the
 * `Reduction` shape has no word for at all. Solving either is the cursor's and the live window's job,
 * not this module's; the job here is to state it truthfully so the design above it is built on the
