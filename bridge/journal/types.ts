// The journal's shared vocabulary — the shape every harness adapter must produce, and the seams the
// store drives them through. Nothing agent-specific lives here.
//
// WHY A JOURNAL EXISTS AT ALL. A pane running an agent usually sits on the terminal's ALTERNATE
// SCREEN, which has no scrollback ring — Herdr's terminal core keeps nothing behind the viewport, so
// `pane.read` can never return more than one screenful (see journal/claude.ts for the measurements).
// The history does exist, though: every harness writes its own session log. This module's job is to
// make "read that log" a per-harness decision behind one interface, so a new harness is an adapter
// rather than a fork of the reader.

/**
 * How an agent named its session, straight off Herdr's `agent_session` record.
 *
 * Two kinds are in the wild and they are NOT interchangeable:
 *  - `id`   — an opaque session id (Claude, Codex). The adapter must find the file itself, so the
 *             value never touches a path until the adapter has validated its shape.
 *  - `path` — an absolute path to the log, reported by the agent (pi). Convenient, but it is
 *             attacker-shaped input by construction: it arrives over the socket from a process we
 *             do not control, so the adapter must still confine it to its own root.
