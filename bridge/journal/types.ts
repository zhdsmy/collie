// SCREEN, which has no scrollback ring — Herdr's terminal core keeps nothing behind the viewport, so
// `pane.read` can never return more than one screenful (see journal/claude.ts for the measurements).
// The history does exist, though: every harness writes its own session log. This module's job is to
// make "read that log" a per-harness decision behind one interface, so a new harness is an adapter
// rather than a fork of the reader.
