// The STRUCTURED form of a tool call, shared by every harness adapter.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS ALONGSIDE `summary`. `summarizeToolInput` (text.ts) collapses a call to one line,
// which is all the transcript view has ever needed: a row that reads "src/app.ts" under the name
// "Read". A card that draws the call properly needs more than a line — which file, how many lines
// moved, whether the command exited non-zero, whether the person denied it. Those are DIFFERENT
// questions per kind of call, so the answer is a discriminated union rather than more optional
// fields on one shape.
//
// The union is deliberately SMALL and closed. Nine kinds cover every tool the six adapters have met,
// because tool vocabularies overlap almost completely: each harness has a read, a shell, a grep and
// an edit under some spelling. A tool outside the nine is not an error, it is `other`, and it still
// carries a name and a summary, so an unrecognised tool degrades to exactly what the view drew
// before this module existed.
//
// It is ADDITIVE. `TranscriptPart`'s tool branch keeps `name` and `summary`, and `call` sits beside
// them. Nothing that reads the journal today has to change, and an adapter that has not been taught
// to fill `call` simply leaves it absent.
