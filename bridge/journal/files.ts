// The filesystem half of the journal, shared by every adapter.
//
// SECURITY. Reading session logs is the journal's only filesystem work, so the path is pinned shut
// here rather than re-argued per harness:
//  - the client never supplies a path — only a pane id, which the route maps to a session ref;
//  - an `id` ref is pattern-validated by its adapter before it is ever concatenated into a path;
//  - a `path` ref (pi reports one) is attacker-shaped by construction — it arrives over the socket
//    from a process we don't control — so it is confined to the harness's own root the same way;
//  - EVERY resolved path is re-checked for containment AFTER symlink resolution, so a log or project
//    directory symlinked out of the root cannot become a way to read arbitrary files;
//  - reads are byte-capped, so a pathological log can't balloon the bridge's memory — twice over
//    since the live read landed: `MAX_TRANSCRIPT_BYTES` bounds a History page, and the smaller
//    `FIRST_TAIL_BYTES` bounds the live window's opening read and every catch-up after a gap.
//
// The live read (`readSinceFile`, at the foot of this file) adds no filesystem surface: it takes
// the path `resolve` already validated, and a cursor whose only power is to name a byte offset
// inside THAT file. A cursor this module refuses costs a reset, never a different file.
//
// A harness may have MORE THAN ONE root (Claude Code's `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` gives a profile its own
// projects tree — see config.ts), which changes nothing about the rule, only how often it is applied:
// a resolved path must lie inside THE ROOT IT WAS RESOLVED THROUGH. For a path an adapter BUILT from
// a root, that is the building root and no other — a candidate that symlinks out of it is skipped
// even if it happens to land inside a sibling root, because the name we followed was that root's. For
// a free-form path ref (pi reports one), no root built it, so any configured root may contain it and
// each is tried in turn ({@link containedRealpathIn}). Both are the same sentence: containment is
// checked per root, never against a union of them.
// A journal is exactly as sensitive as the pane mirror Collie already serves (it is the same
// conversation), but it reaches further back — `COLLIE_TRANSCRIPT=off` disables the feature wholesale.
//
// THE LAW, RESTATED RATHER THAN EXCEPTED. `containedRealpath` is exported and reused outside the
// journal — bridge/operator-fonts.ts serves an operator's own font files under it. That does not
// widen anything, because the rule was never "only the journal touches the disk". The rule is:
//
//   A CLIENT-SUPPLIED VALUE BECOMES A PATH IN TWO PLACES ONLY: THE JOURNAL, AND THE CHANGES VIEW.
//
// In the journal it is a pane id, never a path. The Changes view (bridge/changes.ts, ADR 0065) is
// the second place, and it is bounded by a LISTED-PATHS rule: the client names a repo and a file,
// and both are looked up, never joined blind. The repo must be one the bridge's own discovery under
// the pane's folder returned, and the file one git itself listed as changed there; anything else is
// refused before a path exists. The one file it reads off disk itself (an untracked one) goes
// through `containedRealpath` against the repo's real path as well. The font surface does not become
// a third such place: `GET /api/fonts/<basename>` LOOKS the request's name UP in the rows the
// operator's own `theme.toml` declared and takes THAT row's path, so a name nobody declared is
// refused before any path exists. Containment then runs anyway, as an independent second check on
// the real paths. A new reader may reuse this function; it may not become a third place without an
// ADR that says why and names its bound.

 * cursor left so far behind that catching up would mean holding the gap in memory, and a token that
 * cannot be read.
