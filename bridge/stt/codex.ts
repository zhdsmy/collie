// ── THE CODEX PROVIDER ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// One request, to one endpoint Collie does not get to choose:
// `POST https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/transcribe`, multipart, the audio in a field called `file`,
// authorised by a short-lived token the operator's own `codex` binary handed over (codex-auth.ts).
//
// The endpoint is PRIVATE. It owes Collie nothing, it is undocumented, and it will break. That is
// accepted in ADR 0029 and it is why `collie stt test` exists — so the day it breaks, the failure is
// one command away from being diagnosed instead of being "the microphone stopped working".
//
// ── The identity, which is the whole reason this provider was once declined ──────────────────
//
// #115 reached this endpoint wearing the Codex CLI's `originator` header and the operator's own
// ChatGPT token, silently. Impersonation nobody was asked about is not a trade an operator can
// consent to. So the identity is a SETTING, resolved once by {@link probeCodexIdentity} at
// `collie stt setup`, written into `stt.json` in a word the operator can read back, and never
// inferred at request time:
//
//   • `honest`    — `User-Agent: Collie/<version>`, and NO `originator` header at all.
//   • `codex-cli` — the CLI's headers verbatim, reached only because `honest` was refused and the
//                   operator was told so in the setup consent step.
//
// Everything else mirrors openai.ts's hygiene, because the reasons are the same ones: a manual
// redirect (a 302 must never move an upload with a bearer token on it to a new host), a whole-call
// deadline, a capped response, no reflected error body, and a `fetch` that is a parameter so all of
// it is reachable from `bun test`.
