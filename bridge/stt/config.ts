// Two sources, in one fixed order: `<stateDir>/stt.json`, then the environment on top of it,
// field by field. The environment wins because it is the deployment's own statement — a systemd
// drop-in or a Herdr plugin setting has to be able to point a checkout at a different endpoint
// without editing state the CLI owns.
//
// The file lives in the STATE dir rather than beside the operator's `.env`, for the reason pairing
// does: it can hold a credential, so it is written 0600 into a 0700 directory by `collie stt setup`
// and is never an operator-authored TOML anyone is invited to hand-edit. Nothing here writes it —
// this module only ever reads.
//
// It is re-read at request time behind an mtime check, exactly like `commands.toml` (and through
// the very same {@link OperatorFileIo} seam), so `collie stt setup` goes live with no restart. The
// path is derived from the state dir at startup and is NEVER client-supplied.
//
// A malformed file is a HOLD, never a 500: the last good settings keep serving, warned once per
// change rather than once per request. Feature-on is not a switch — it is "a provider resolved".
