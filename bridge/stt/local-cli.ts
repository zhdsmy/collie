// ── THE LOCAL-CLI PROVIDER (#227) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// One child per recording: `<command> [args…] <tempPath>`, and its trimmed stdout is the
// transcript. It is for an operator who already runs an on-device engine behind a command line
// (Muesli's `muesli-cli transcribe <file>`, a `whisper-cli` build) and should not have to stand up
// an HTTP server beside it to reach the `openai-compatible` provider. No audio leaves the host
// unless the operator's own command sends it somewhere.
//
// What the bridge gives up, said plainly: on this provider it SPAWNS A CHILD AS THE BRIDGE USER for
// every dictation (ADR 0029, addendum 2026-10-03). The bounds below are why that is acceptable:
//
//   • argv, never a shell — `Bun.spawn([command, ...args, path])`. Nothing is parsed, expanded or
//     globbed, so a stray character in the settings is an odd argument, not a second command.
//   • the operator's words only — `command` and `args` come from `stt.json` (0600, written by
//     `collie stt setup`) or the deployment's environment. The ONE value a request contributes is
//     the recording's bytes, written to a file whose name and extension Collie chose. The client's
//     content type picks the extension only through the allow-list in `bridge/stt/http.ts`, and it
//     is checked again here before it becomes part of a path.
//   • a private temp dir — `mkdtemp` under the OS temp dir, forced to 0700, the file written 0600
//     with `wx`, and the whole directory removed in `finally`, success or failure.
//   • the same 60 s deadline `openai-compatible` has, enforced with SIGKILL — a hung engine is
//     killed, not waited out, and not asked politely.
//   • the whole tree, not just the child — on Linux and macOS the command starts in a process group
//     of its own (`detached`), and every kill is `kill(-pgid, SIGKILL)`. A wrapper script whose
//     engine runs as ITS child would otherwise leave the engine running after the wrapper died. The
//     group is also killed after a clean exit, so nothing the command left behind in its group
//     outlives the call; a helper that means to stay must leave the group (`setsid`), as daemons do.
//     Windows has no process group to kill by a negative pid, so there the kill goes by PROCESS
//     TREE: `taskkill /PID <pid> /T /F`, by its absolute `%SystemRoot%\System32` path and as argv,
//     ends the command and every live process below it; then one PowerShell pass ends what the
//     command left behind after it exited, found by parent pid and by a start time inside the call
//     (so a reused pid is never taken for ours). Both run in the background, bounded, and never
//     throw. The one gap: a process whose own parent had already exited, and was not the command
//     itself, has no parent left to be found by.
//   • a capped stdout — the same 256 KiB as an HTTP answer, refused mid-stream, and the group (the
//     tree, on Windows) is killed at that moment, not at the deadline. The cap and the in-flight cap
//     below behave the same on every platform.
//   • a cap of its own on children in flight — {@link LOCAL_CLI_MAX_IN_FLIGHT}, refused before any
//     temp file or spawn — and a slot is only given back once the child has exited.
//   • a command that is a regular, executable file — checked by `status()` and by `collie stt`.
//   • stderr is never read and never forwarded. The phone gets Collie's own sentence and an exit
//     status; a command line or an engine's error output may name a path, a model or a token.
//   • no `COLLIE_*` variable is passed down. The bridge's environment carries the push keys and
//     the STT credential of other providers, none of which a transcription command needs.
