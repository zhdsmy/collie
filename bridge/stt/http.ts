// dispatch line and the gate stay inside `Bun.serve`, which the runner cannot stand up (CLAUDE.md).
//
// The body is RAW AUDIO BYTES, not multipart. The client has exactly one thing to send and the
// bridge has exactly one thing to read; wrapping it in a multipart envelope would only add a parse
// (and a second size to reconcile) for no field anyone needs.
