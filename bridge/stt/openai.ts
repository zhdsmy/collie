// ── THE OPENAI-COMPATIBLE PROVIDER ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// One request, to one configured endpoint: `POST {baseUrl}/audio/transcriptions`, multipart, the
// audio in a field called `file`. That request shape is the whole of the "OpenAI-compatible"
// contract, which is why this is plain `fetch` and not the `openai` npm package — the SDK buys
// nothing here but a dependency, and its keyless mode needs tricks (a placeholder key plus a
// header-deleting override) that plain `fetch` does not need at all: no credential simply means no
// `Authorization` header.
//
// Four bounds, all of them because the endpoint is operator-configured and may be anything:
//   • redirect: "error"  — a 302 must never move an upload with a credential on it to a new host.
//   • a 60 s deadline    — enforced over the whole call, body included, not just the headers.
//   • a 256 KiB response cap — a transcript is text; anything larger is a misconfigured endpoint
//                              or a hostile one, and it is refused mid-stream rather than buffered.
//   • no retries         — the audio is gone once the recording ends; a retry would re-upload the
//                          same bytes into the same failure, and the operator can simply speak again.
//
// `fetch` is a parameter so all of the above is reachable from `bun test` (CLAUDE.md: only
// Bun.serve / Bun.connect code stays unit-untested).
