 *

 * broker owns a long-running `codex app-server` child, so a provider rebuilt per request would be a
 * child spawned per request. The rule is one provider per distinct settings value, and the outgoing
 * one is CLOSED as the new one is built — a config edit replaces the child rather than orphaning it.
