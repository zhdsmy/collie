// ── The agents the New sheet can start, by id, per machine (ADR 0091) ────────────────────────────
//
// The phone holds no list of harness names. It asks the machine a start would go to
// (`GET /api/launchers`, forwarded on `?host=` like the operator's rows), and that machine answers
// with the harnesses Collie knows and whether each binary is there. The phone then names one by its
// id, and the bridge, never the phone, turns the id into the line that is typed. So a phone cannot
// start a binary nobody listed, exactly as it cannot run a command line `launchers.toml` does not hold.
//
// ── WHICH NAMES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The ids are agent names the mux contract already accepts (`bridge/mux/agents.ts`): the name a pane
// reports once the agent runs is the name it was started by, so the started pane reads with its own
// harness straight away. `harness-launch.test.ts` fails when a contract name is neither here nor in
// {@link NOT_STARTED}. The binary is the same word: Herdr names an agent by its process, which is
// what made these the contract's names in the first place.
//
// ── FOUND, WITH THE LOGIN SHELL'S PATH ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A bridge under systemd or Herdr has a short PATH. The operator's shell, the one the new pane runs,
// sources a profile, and that is where `~/.opencode/bin` or an nvm folder is added (on bluefin both
// `opencode` and `pi` live there). So the search runs over the login shell's PATH, asked once per
// process with argv only and a short cap, and falls back to the bridge's own PATH when the shell
// cannot be asked. `findTool` then adds its fixed folders (`bridge/tools.ts`). A found result is kept
// for {@link FOUND_TTL_MS}, so a phone that opens the sheet twice in a row costs one look.
