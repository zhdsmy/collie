// Platform dial shim. On Unix the herdr API socket is a real AF_UNIX socket and Bun.connect
// handles it. On Windows (herdr Windows beta) the ".sock" path is a pointer file — the actual
// transport is a named pipe whose name is the full socket path (\\.\pipe\C:\...\herdr.sock).
// Bun.connect({unix}) cannot open named pipes, but Bun's node:net can, so we adapt it to the
// same handler shape the two call sites in herdr-client.ts use (write/flush/end only).
//
// There is NO application-level handshake on either transport — herdr's `interprocess` local
// sockets carry the raw bytes ("Interprocess never inserts its own message framing or any other
// type of metadata into the stream"), so the same newline-delimited JSON-RPC speaks to both. A
// raw node:net client dialing the Unix socket was verified against a live herd on 2026-07-26.
