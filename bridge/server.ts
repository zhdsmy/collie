 *
 * A custom request header is the check because a no-cors cross-site request **cannot set one** —
 * doing so promotes it to a preflighted CORS request, and the bridge answers no preflight. Our own

 *
 * Write actions (reply/keys/upload/close/rename) need no header: they already cleared

/**
 * Access gate for the API:

 *    loopback form, one of those hosts, or the host of an allowed origin — otherwise rejected,
 *    BEFORE any Origin logic (fail-closed). This defeats DNS rebinding, where a browser is tricked
 *    into sending Host==Origin==evil.example so a bare same-origin check trivially passes — acute
 *    under COLLIE_SERVE_MODE=http (no TLS). Empty COLLIE_PUBLIC_HOSTS keeps the legacy behaviour so
 *    existing deployments don't break (see the startup warning).
 *  - Same-origin only (Origin host must equal Host) — defeats cross-site requests/CSRF. Browsers
 *    omit Origin on same-origin GETs (so the snapshot poll passes); they send it on POSTs.
 *    localhost and explicitly-configured origins are also allowed.
 *  - Origin required for writes: a state-changing (`level === "write"`) request with no Origin is
 *    trusted only from loopback (curl on the host). Browsers always send Origin on fetch/SW POSTs,
 *    so a missing Origin on a remote write is a non-browser or Origin-stripped request — reject it.
 *  - Optional Tailscale identity: if a trusted user is configured and `tailscale serve` injects a
 *    `Tailscale-User-Login`, it must match.

/**
 * Optional per-device authorisation, layered on top of {@link checkAccess}. Off by default; enabled
 * by setting COLLIE_DEVICE_HEADER to the header a trusted upstream proxy injects, carrying an opaque
 * device identifier. The header is trusted only because the bridge binds loopback behind the proxy,
 * so a direct client can't forge it (the same trust basis as the Tailscale identity header). Matrix:
 *
 *   - feature off (no header configured) → not enforced, fully authorised (today's behaviour).
 *   - header absent                      → read-only, same as an unlisted device. Configuring the
 *                                          header is the operator asserting that the proxy sets it
 *                                          on every request, so a request without one did not come
 *                                          through that proxy and must not drive a terminal.
 *   - header present, value allowlisted  → authorised; the session is attributed to that device.
 *   - header present, value not listed   → read-only. The "unknown" sentinel is never authorised,
 *                                          and an empty allowlist makes every device read-only — a
 *                                          fail-closed default for a security toggle you turned on.
 *
 * "Read-only" is the whole scope of this gate, deliberately: {@link guard} consults it only for
 * `"write"`, so a header-less caller still reads panes. That is the existing design (a read-only
 * device is meant to watch), and this function does not change it. What changes is that a missing
 * header no longer counts as the operator.
 *
 * The absent-header case deliberately has no loopback exemption. It looks like the natural place for
 * one, but every supported front door is a proxy co-located with the bridge (tailscale serve and the
 * documented reverse proxies all connect to 127.0.0.1), so a loopback peer says nothing about
 * whether the caller is the operator on the host or a remote client whose proxy failed to inject the
 * header. Driving a pane from the host is still one flag away: send an allowlisted id yourself.
