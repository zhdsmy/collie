// A day of load per machine, one bucket per minute, kept on the lead (or on a solo collie).
//
// ── WHY THE LEAD KEEPS IT, AND NOT EACH MEMBER ───────────────────────────────
// The phone talks to the lead, and the lead already hears every member's last sample on the sweep it
// runs anyway (CREW_PROTOCOL.md §10.1). Keeping the day there costs no new route on the crew link and
// no dial the phone can trigger. The price is named in ADR 0084: a member's history has gaps for the
// minutes the lead was down or the member was unreachable, and nothing back-fills them.
//
// ── IN MEMORY, SAVED FROM THE TICK ───────────────────────────────────────────
// `record` and `points` touch memory only. The owner (`bridge/machines.ts`) saves the whole store to
// `machine-history.json` at most every five minutes and on shutdown, from the engine tick, never from
// a timer of its own. A crash loses at most five minutes, which is the trade for not writing a file
// every few seconds. The file is atomic (`tmp` then `rename`) and owner-only (mode 0600, inside a
// state folder that is itself owner-only on every platform, ACL-locked on Windows).
//
// ── ONE RING OF TYPED ARRAYS PER MACHINE ─────────────────────────────────────
// A minute is a handful of numbers, and a day is 1440 minutes. Kept as one object per minute, a
// machine's day held about 175 KiB of heap (measured 2026-10-05 under Bun 1.4.1). Kept here as a ring
// of typed arrays, allocated once at the first sample, it is 1440 x 48 bytes, about 68 KiB with the
// disk fraction, and it never grows. Each minute keeps running AVERAGES and their counts rather than sums: an average is what
// every reader wants, and the next sample folds in with `avg += (x - avg) / n`. CPU, memory and disk
// stay 64-bit, because the alert evaluator compares them with the rule's line and a 32-bit 0.9 is
// below 0.9. The CPU maximum and the network rates are 32-bit: they are only ever drawn.
//
// ── THE FILE IS COMPACT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Version 2 stores, per machine, the first minute's start and one row per minute,
// `[gap, cpu, cpuMax, mem, rx, tx]` plus a seventh value, the fullest disk's fraction, on a minute that
// has one. `gap` is the minutes since the row before (1 for a whole run) and the fractions are rounded
// to three places. Only the last row's sample count is kept, as
// `n`: it is the one minute a sample may still fold into. One machine's full day is about 46 KiB (54 KiB with the disk value),
// where version 1 (nine sums per minute, epoch milliseconds on every row) was about 80 KiB, and the
// file is rewritten every five minutes. The disk value adds about 6 bytes a row. Version 1 still loads,
// and so does a version 2 file written before the disk value (its minutes have none).
