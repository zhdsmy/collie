// WHERE A BEACON'S REF MEETS THE JOURNAL (M11/04). Nothing under `bridge/journal/` changes to make
// pane history work on tmux or zellij: the decorator (M11/03) fills `MuxPane.agentSession` from the
// beacon and the existing route, registry, adapter and containment run unmodified. That claim is only
// worth as much as its proof, so these tests walk the whole seam end to end — sweep a beacon
// directory, take the reading's identity, ask the registry for the adapter, and hand the adapter the
// ref — against REAL files, because containment is a question about symlinks and real paths and
// cannot be answered against a fake.
//
// WHICH IS WHY THIS FILE SITS HERE AND NOT UNDER `bridge/beacon/`. That directory's rule is that no
// filesystem call of any kind appears under it, and M11/04 greps for it rather than trusting it
// (`git grep -nE 'readFile|Bun.file|realpath' -- bridge/beacon` must be empty). A test needing real
// symlinks is a filesystem call, so it lives beside `beacon-io.ts` — the same split, for the same
// reason. `bun test bridge/beacon` still selects it: the filter matches the file path.
//
// Two rules are pinned here and they are the two a later change could break with no type error:
//
//  1. AN EXPIRED BEACON STILL YIELDS HISTORY. Expiry retires an IDENTITY — the status claim and the
//     agent label both go, and the pane reads as a shell again (M11/03) — but never the session ref.
//     A finished conversation is still on disk and still readable, so the ref and the harness that
//     wrote it travel on with the pane, server-side and invisible: `journalAgentOf` is what the
//     history route asks, and it is the only consumer.
//
//  2. A PATH-KIND REF IS CONFINED, WITH NO CARVE-OUT FOR "THE OPERATOR INSTALLED THE HOOK". Today's
//     Claude emitter writes `id` refs only, so the path case here is synthetic on purpose: it is the
//     rule for a FUTURE emitter that has no stable id (pi's existing shape), written down while the
//     seam is being built rather than when somebody needs it. Anything that can write into the beacon
//     directory is the threat model, so a beacon-supplied path has exactly pi's standing and reaches
//     the disk through `containedRealpathIn` or not at all.
