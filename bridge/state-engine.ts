// a failed poll just retries next tick, and reconnection needs no special handling.
//
// It talks the mux port (mux/types.ts) and no multiplexer's own vocabulary: every Herdr-shaped
// derivation this file used to do inline — the workspace join, the meaningful tab label, the
// terminal-title strip, the agent-session ownership check, the session.snapshot fallback — moved
// into the adapter, where the multiplexer that knows those facts lives (bridge/mux/herdr/adapter.ts).

// How many lines to read per claude pane when sniffing its `/rename` session name. Claude's input
// box (and the named rule above it) sits at the very tail, so a small window is plenty and keeps the
// extra per-poll reads cheap.
//
// The scope MUST stay `viewport`. A `recent` text read asking for more rows than the pane currently
// shows makes Herdr harvest the pages above the viewport, and on a full-screen agent (Claude runs on
// the alternate screen, which has no host scrollback) the only way to reach them is to drive the
// agent's own mouse-scroll interface: Herdr scrolls the pane up page by page, then restores it. The
// operator watches their terminal jump and snap back — once per poll, per idle claude pane.
// `viewport` cannot do that whatever this count is: it is the rendered screen, clamped to it. Which
// is also why this number is free to stay generous — the run below the ❯ prompt is a statusline of
// unknown height ([ADR 0004](../.adr/0004-the-statusline-run-is-bounded.md)), so headroom is worth
// more here than a smaller read. See HERDR_API.md → `pane.read`.
