// The ONE managed front door's ownership record, and the only code that takes it down. ADR 0001 is
// the whole point of this module: Collie manages exactly one `tailscale serve` mapping, records it,
// and only ever tears down a mapping still matching that record. The failure mode a bug here
// produces is not a broken Collie — it is a stranger's service silently unpublished.
//
// ── WHY THIS IS IN `bridge/` AND NOT IN `cli/serve.ts`, WHERE IT WAS ─────────
// Two processes now have to take that mapping down, and there must not be two implementations of
// "only what we recorded":
//
//   • `collie unserve` / the teardown half of `collie serve` — the operator's own verb;
//   • **the bridge, at boot, when it comes up as a `peer`** — the gap a live takeover drill found.
//     A deposed lead self-heals to `peer` on materials it already holds, but its `tailscale serve`
//     mapping outlived the crown. Two things went wrong at once: the peer listener could not bind
//     its tailnet address, because tailscaled already owned that port, so the bridge crash-looped;
//     and the public hostname kept routing into a machine that answers nothing. Neither is fixable
//     by the new lead — a front door is the losing machine's own to close (ADR 0001) — so the
//     losing machine closes it itself, through this exact code path and no other.
//
// The bridge does not import from `cli/`, so the shared half lives here and `cli/serve.ts` imports
// it. Publishing did NOT move: a peer must never be able to open a door, so the only thing it can
// reach is the closing half.
//
// Every outside effect is a seam ({@link FrontDoorDeps}) — `bun test` drives the whole teardown,
// including the refusal, without a tailnet.

// ── The ownership record ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// `https:443|host.ts.net:443|http://127.0.0.1:8787`. The format is NOT versioned, moved or
// migrated — a host upgrading from the shell to the binary must find its existing record valid.
