//     LENGTH BASE64 CAN PRODUCE: never ≡ 1 (mod 4). RFC 8030 §5.4 only calls the topic URL-safe
//     base64; Apple enforces that by decoding it, while FCM and Mozilla treat it as opaque. A
//     13-character topic decodes nowhere (base64 turns 3 bytes into 4 chars, so a trailing group of
//     one is impossible) and APNs answers 400 `{"reason":"BadWebPushTopic"}` for every endpoint.

//     "collie-updat" (12), "collie-herd" (11) and "collie-updates" (14) all succeed — so it is the
//     arithmetic, not a length cap and not the wording. `topicIsSendable` pins this below.
//   • `TTL` (seconds) bounds how long the service holds an undelivered message: 6h is long enough to
//     reach a briefly-offline phone but short enough that a day-old "needs you" doesn't resurface.

//     web-push defaults to `normal` (RFC 8030), FCM maps that to normal priority, and Android is then
//     free to hold the message until the next Doze maintenance window — or to defer it by the PWA's
//     App Standby bucket, which DEEPENS the less you open the app. That degrades into a vicious
//     circle rather than a clean break: fewer alerts → fewer opens → deeper bucket → fewer alerts.
//     Live-diagnosed by sending one endpoint the same payload at both urgencies minutes apart: normal
//     never arrived, high arrived at once. Retractions ride this too, deliberately — a deferred
//     `clear` leaves a handled alert on your lock screen, the exact thing the coordinator exists to
