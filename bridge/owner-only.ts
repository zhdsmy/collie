// PRIVATE TO YOUR ACCOUNT: WHO MAY READ COLLIE'S SECRETS, ON EVERY HOST (M43 spec 04).
//
// The trust store, the pairing registry, push subscriptions, the VAPID key in `.env` and the rest
// must be readable by the account that runs Collie only. On Linux and macOS the mode bits say that
// (files 0600, folders 0700), and nothing here changes how. NTFS has no mode bits: `stat` reports
// 666 or 777 and `chmod` flips only the read-only flag, so on Windows the guarantee comes from the
// access list, and this module is the one door to it. The callers import from here only:
//
//   `sddl.ts`        the text of an access list, and the allowlist rule (pure)
//   `acl-policy.ts`  what Collie may change and what it only looks at (pure)
//   `icacls.ts`      the Windows tools, by absolute path, bounded
//
// THE THREE ANSWERS. A path is `private`, `loose` (a VERIFIED grant to someone outside the
// allowlist, with who and what), or `not-checked` (with the reason: a link, a network share, no
// access list, a tool that failed or ran out of time). Only `loose` is ever reported as a leak, and
// only `loose` can make the config loader withhold a secret.
//
// THE REPAIR runs in the bridge process at start and nowhere else (a CLI command only verifies and
// warns), only on a folder `acl-policy.ts` calls Collie's own, and never with `/T`. It changes the
// folder in ONE `icacls` call, grants first and the end of inheritance after (so the list is never
// empty for a moment: proven on the VM with a reader in another process, 0 failed reads), then
// resets to "inherit" only the entries a second check still finds loose, after a fresh `lstat` of
// each (no link, no hard link). The old lists are saved first, and the line to put them back is
// printed. Not `icacls /restore` for the change: it needs the Restore privilege, which a standard
// user does not hold (VM, 2026-10-02: error 1300). `COLLIE_NO_ACL_REPAIR=1` turns every change off; the check
// still runs and still warns.
