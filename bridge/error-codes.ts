// ── THE ERROR CODE CATALOGUE — one file, one place the wire's refusals are named ────────────────
//
// Collie's web app speaks the operator's language (web/src/lib/i18n/). The bridge does not: an
// `{ ok: false, error: "…" }` body is English prose written on the host, and it lands on the phone
// screen verbatim. This file is how that stops being the end of the story.
//
// THE RULE: an error body the phone can display carries a STABLE MACHINE CODE beside its sentence.
// The sentence is unchanged and stays the fallback — a client with no translation for a code still
// says something true, and an older client that ignores `code` behaves exactly as it does today.
// Nothing here renames a field, removes one, or moves a status code.
//
// THE SENTENCE AND THE CODE CANNOT DRIFT, because they are not written in two places: a handler
// names a code and {@link apiError} renders the sentence from THIS table. A handler cannot ship a
// code with different words than the catalogue says it has, because it never writes the words.
//
// TEMPLATES, NOT CONCATENATION. `{name}` marks a slot filled from the `detail` object — the same
// convention `web/src/lib/i18n/` uses, for the same reason: the translated sentence needs those
// values too, so they travel as NAMED FIELDS beside the code rather than baked into a string the
// client would have to re-parse. `{ maxBytes: 10485760 }` is usable; "max 10 MB" is not.
//
// A TEMPLATE THAT IS ONLY `{reason}` is not a mistake. Several refusals are the multiplexer's own
// words passed through (`herdr` said "no such pane"), and Collie must keep sending them byte for
// byte. The code says WHAT FAILED — which is the part a translator can act on — and `detail.reason`
// carries the untranslatable remainder.
//
// THE CLIENT MIRROR is `web/src/lib/api-error-codes.ts`. The two trees are type-checked separately
// (web/tsconfig.json includes only `src`), so the union is restated there rather than imported —
// the same arrangement `bridge/json.ts` / `web/src/lib/json.ts` already uses. They are held
// identical by `bridge/error-codes.test.ts`, which reads both files off disk and compares the sets.
// Adding a code here without adding it there fails that test.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT IN HERE:
//   • Plain-text refusals (`text("bad body", 400)`, a 403 gate reason, a 405). They are not JSON, so
//     there is no field to add one to — coding them would mean changing the response shape, which is
//     exactly what this change promised not to do.
//   • Pack-link errors (`bridge/pack/`). That surface is versioned separately (PACK_PROTOCOL.md) and
//     is guarded at commit time (ADR 0025); it keeps today's bodies in this release.
//   • Push/OS notification text (`bridge/notifications.ts`). Different surface, different follow-up.
