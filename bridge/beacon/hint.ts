// THE HINT TIER — the ONE module in the tree that turns a process name into anything (M11/05).
//
// A pane whose foreground command looks like a harness may carry a SENTENCE. That is the whole
// feature, and every constraint on it is about what it must not become:
//
//  • It sets no identity — not the pane's agent, not its status, not the session ref an agent named.
//    The reasoning is `bridge/mux/types.ts` § `MuxPane.agent`, cited rather than restated, and it is
//    why the port answers `"shell"` instead of guessing from a process name.
//  • It arms no grammar, keys no journal adapter and never enters the triage sort. A hinted pane is
//    a shell of unknown standing that has a sentence attached to it.
//  • What reaches the phone is finished English — no harness name, no multiplexer name — so
//    `web/src` learns nothing new and renders text it does not interpret.
//
// ── WHY THE MATCHING IS HERE AND THE FIELD IS THERE ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The adapter reports the raw fact it already holds (`MuxPane.foregroundCommand`); this module is
// the only reader of it, and a repo-level grep proves that. Put the matching in the adapters and
// every adapter re-invents it; put the sentence in the frontend and the names cross the boundary.
//
// ── SUPPRESSION IS THE FEATURE, NOT A TRIMMING ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Three conditions each retire the sentence, and each for its own reason (see {@link paneHint}). A
// hint on a pane that already has identity is not extra context — it is Collie asking for something
// it has.
