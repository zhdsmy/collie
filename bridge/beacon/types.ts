// THE BEACON CONTRACT — what an agent may tell Collie about itself, and nothing more.
//
// A pane Collie did not spawn has no identity: the multiplexer adapters underneath (tmux, zellij)
// declare `agentDetection: false` and say why at the line — `pane_current_command` is whatever is in
// the foreground this second, and a wrong agent name picks a wrong harness grammar AND a wrong
// journal adapter. The agent itself, however, knows exactly who it is. A beacon is the one way it
// can say so: its own hooks write this record, Collie reads it, and nothing is inferred.
//
// ── A BEACON IS A HINT, NEVER A CONTROL CHANNEL (.adr/0024) ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// Everything below is READ. No field here can cause a send, a key, a rename or a close, arm a mode,
// relax a guard or bypass a gate. The reader's output is consumed by the snapshot join (M11/03) and
// the journal key (M11/04) and by nothing else. Anything that can write into the beacon directory is
// the threat model — not the operator who installed the hook — so a `path` carried in a beacon has
// exactly the standing of pi's `path` session ref: attacker-shaped by construction, and it reaches
// the filesystem only through `journal/files.ts` containment or not at all.
//
// ── KEYED BY THE PANE, NOT THE SESSION ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// One file per pane, named by a digest of the markers ({@link ../beacon/paths.ts}). Keying by session
// id would make `/clear` — which mints a new session id mid-pane — leave a stale beacon beside the
// fresh one, and the pane would carry two identities until a TTL expired one. Keyed by the pane,
// `/clear` is an ordinary overwrite. One live agent per pane is the truth on every multiplexer
// Collie drives.

 * is the only one that carries the field at all, so there is no way to read a stale status by
 * accident. It asserts no liveness of any kind.
 *
 * What that harness name is SPENT ON is the join's decision, and the join spends it on the journal
 * lookup alone: an expired beacon does not label its pane, which goes back to reading as a shell
 * (`bridge/beacon/decorate.ts` § decoratePane, .adr/0024 "expired ... is absent").
 *
 * ABSENT is the third case and it is not in this union on purpose: the reader simply returns nothing
 * for that pane, and the pane reads as a shell with `unknown` status exactly as it does today.
 * "No beacon" and "the agent is resting" look identical from outside and mean opposite things to a
 * triage, so absence must never become `idle`.
