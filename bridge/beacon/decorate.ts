// THE DECORATOR — where a blind adapter gains sight, and stays honest (M11/03).
//
// `withAgentBeacons` takes an adapter that cannot see agents, joins its snapshot panes to beacons
// through that multiplexer's own environment markers, and is THE ONLY THING that declares
// `agentDetection` and `agentSessionRef` true on such an adapter. The adapters underneath never
// change their declaration, so conformance proves the decorated build and the raw one separately.
//
// ── ONE DECORATOR, NOT A FOURTH ADAPTER ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// It touches exactly two things: the capability declaration, and the panes coming out of
// `snapshot()`. Every other method is passed straight through — a decorator that reimplements
// `sendKeys` is a fork, and `decorate.test.ts` pins the pass-through method by method.
//
// ── IT REFUSES TO DECORATE AN ADAPTER THAT ALREADY SEES ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// An adapter whose multiplexer reports the agent and its session from its own wire has a STRONGER
// source of truth than a beacon. Wrapping it would put a second, weaker one beside it, and the two
// would disagree the moment a hook was missed. So a wrapped adapter declaring either capability is
// refused loudly, at construction, rather than silently producing a pane with two identities.
//
// ── THE DECORATOR HOLDS NO MULTIPLEXER KNOWLEDGE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The join is per-namespace and every part of it that is about a particular multiplexer lives beside
// that multiplexer's adapter, as a {@link BeaconMatcher}: which marker namespace to read, what this
// adapter's own addressing scope is, and how a raw marker names one of its panes. This file knows
// only how to ASK — which is what keeps it generic, and what keeps `scripts/check-mux-names.sh`
// green without a carve-out (the operator-facing note is adapter-supplied data, not a literal here).
//
// ── EVENTS ARE NOT SYNTHESISED, AND THAT IS A DECISION ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A beacon's status changing is a pane event the wrapped adapter cannot see, so in principle
// `watch()` should fire for it. It does not, in M11, and this comment sits where someone would add
// it: the snapshot poll already carries status to the phone on its adaptive interval, and a
// beacon-directory watcher would be a second filesystem watcher bought for a second's worth of
// latency. `watch` is therefore an untouched pass-through and `pushPaneEvents` stays exactly as the
// wrapped adapter declared it — a decorator that declared a push it does not make would be lying in
// the one direction the conformance suite cannot catch.
