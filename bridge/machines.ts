// The lead's watch over every machine's load: the last sample each one gave, a day of minutes, and
// the alert rules (ADR 0084). A solo collie runs the same watch over its one machine.
//
// ── NO TIMER, AND NOTHING HERE DIALS ─────────────────────────────────────────
// Samples arrive two ways and both are hooks that already run: this machine's own sampler, read from
// the state engine's tick, and each member's `machineStats`, read off the answer the lead's sweep
// already parsed (CREW_PROTOCOL.md §10.1). {@link MachineWatch.tick} runs from that same engine tick,
// judges the alert rules once a minute and saves the history at most every five minutes. The class
// arms nothing, which is the rule `CacheWarden` and `CrewLead` keep for the same reason.
//
// ── WHAT THE PHONE READS IS ALREADY HERE ─────────────────────────────────────
// `rows()` and `history()` read memory. The roster comes from the same closure `GET /api/crew` reads,
// so asking about machines can no more make the lead dial a member than asking about the crew can.
//
// ── THE SAMPLE RATE FOLLOWS THE PHONE ────────────────────────────────────────
// `rows()` notes when a phone last asked. For {@link MACHINES_WATCH_MS} after that, this machine
// samples at most every 5 s (`SAMPLE_WATCHED_MS`); otherwise at most every 15 s (`SAMPLE_IDLE_MS`).
// Nothing is armed: the engine tick asks {@link MachineWatch.sampleEveryMs} each time it runs. The
// Machines list and a machine's page ask on every poll (4 to 6 s), the dashboard's Crew tab every
// 15 s, so all three hold the fast rate, and a phone put away drops it within 30 s.
//
// The idle arithmetic, which the alert rules lean on (ALERT_COVERAGE in machine-alerts.ts: 80 % of
// a window's minutes must hold data). The tick runs every 12 s while the multiplexer's event stream
// is healthy and every 1.5 s otherwise, plus once per event poke. A 15 s floor on a 12 s tick takes a
// sample on every second tick, 24 s apart, so every minute bucket holds two or three samples and
// none is empty. On a 1.5 s tick it is one every 15 s, four per minute. Any idle tick up to 60 s
// still leaves no minute empty, because the gap between two samples is then the tick itself.
//
// A member has no phone asking, so it samples at the idle rate and serves the sample it holds to
// every sweep. The lead skips a sample equal to the last one it took ({@link MachineWatch.observe}),
// so it records each of the member's samples once: a new one every 24 s at most, stamped on the
// lead's clock within one lead tick of the member taking it. The gap between two stamps is at most
// 24 s plus one 12 s lead tick, 36 s, so a member's minute buckets are never empty either.
