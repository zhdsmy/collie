// THE MUX CONFORMANCE ENGINE — what makes "does tmux work" a test result instead of an opinion.
//
// One suite, run against every adapter in `registry.ts` (see conformance.test.ts, which iterates it),
// answering the four questions an adapter can get wrong in a way nothing above it can repair:
//
//  1. **Is the capability declaration honest?** In BOTH directions. Every capability declared true is
//     exercised and must actually work; every one declared false is CALLED and must answer the
//     contract's `unsupported` — naming itself — rather than throwing, succeeding, or returning an
//     empty value that reads as success.
//  2. **Is identity stable?** The same pane keeps its Collie id across a reconnect of the adapter, an
//     out-of-band rename, and a restart of the multiplexer; two panes never collide; a dead pane's id
//     is never handed to a new one (identity.ts rules 2–4).
//  3. **Are the semantics the contract's, not the adapter's?** The grid has the shape `MuxGrid`
//     describes, a `strip` read carries no escapes, sends arrive in the order they were made, and a
//     write to a pane that has gone away answers `gone` — not `unreachable`, which would invite a
//     retry that can only fail the same way.
//  4. **Does it degrade rather than lie?** Nothing answers "ok" where it means "I can't": a constant
//     `revision` (which silently disables the race guard), an `unsupportedKeys` entry that is quietly
//     sent anyway, a declared `agentDetection` behind which every pane is a shell.
//
// THIS FILE IS FRAMEWORK-FREE ON PURPOSE. A check returns its problems as strings; nothing here
// imports `bun:test`. That is what lets the SAME checks run in two layers:
//
//   • the PURE layer — `conformance.test.ts`, `bun test`, no multiplexer installed, every adapter
//     driven through its own fixture's fake transport;
//   • the LIVE layer — `scripts/mux-probe.ts`, opt-in, against a real multiplexer, running only
//     {@link MUX_READ_ONLY_CHECKS}, because a live pane is somebody's work session.
//
// THE SPLIT IS BY WRITES, and it is the whole safety story of the live layer. A read-only check calls
// nothing that can change a pane — including calls to UNDECLARED verbs, which by definition refuse
// before they touch anything. Everything that types, renames, closes or kills lives in
// {@link MUX_WORLD_CHECKS}, which only ever runs against a fixture's fake world.
//
// WHAT AN ADAPTER OWES THIS SUITE is one {@link MuxConformanceFixture}: how to build itself against
// an injected transport, and how to make that transport do the six things no adapter can simulate
// from the outside (reconnect, mux restart, out-of-band rename, changed content, a pane dying, and a
// structure change nobody announced).
// Adding tmux (M10/04) or zellij (M10/05) is that fixture plus a registry entry — never a test file.

 * which is why {@link MuxConformanceFixture.create} is what the engine holds rather than a world.
 *
 * A conforming world starts non-trivial: **at least three live panes across at least two tabs**, at
 * least one of which reports an agent (when the adapter declares `agentDetection`) and an agent
 * session (when it declares `agentSessionRef`). A world of one bare shell would let half the suite
 * pass vacuously — nothing about ids staying unique across two containers.
 *
 * TWO SPACES TOO, WHEREVER THE MULTIPLEXER HAS TWO. Herdr and tmux do, and their fixtures seed them.
 * zellij does NOT — every one of its verbs is scoped to one session, so an adapter instance is one
 * space by construction (M10/05) — and requiring two there would be requiring an adapter to fake a
