// HERDR, BEHIND THE CONTRACT — the reference adapter (M10/02).
//
// Everything above this file talks the mux port (../types.ts); everything below it (`client.ts`)
// talks Herdr's socket. So this module is the whole translation, and it is deliberately the ONLY
// place that holds both vocabularies at once:
//
//   • the mapping from Herdr's wire records to `MuxPane` / `MuxSpace` / `MuxTab`, including the
//     three derivations the state engine used to do inline (the workspace join, the meaningful
//     tab label, the meaningful terminal title) — those are *what the multiplexer knows*, so they
//     belong to the adapter that knows it;
//   • the `session.snapshot` → three-list-calls fallback for a server that predates the method,
//     which is a Herdr version fact and nothing the port should ever hear about;
//   • the key spelling (keys.ts) and the event subscriptions (events.ts).
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It never reaches across a machine boundary: `MuxTarget.endpoint` is a local
// socket path and `dial.ts` picks a LOCAL dialer for it (unix socket / Windows named pipe). A remote
// herd is reached by talking to the Collie running on that machine, never by dialling its Herdr
// (ADR 0011, ADR 0022) — so nothing here grows a host, and neither does dial.ts.
//
// CAPABILITIES ARE DECLARED FROM THE METHODS BELOW, one for one. Herdr implements every one of the
// contract's fourteen, which is unsurprising — Collie's routes were written against Herdr — and is
// exactly why the declaration must be read off the implementation rather than assumed: the value of
// the list is that the NEXT adapter's is shorter.
