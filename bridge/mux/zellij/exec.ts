// HOW THE ZELLIJ ADAPTER TALKS TO ZELLIJ — one narrow seam, and the only file that spawns a process.
//
// zellij's client is the `zellij` binary, exactly as tmux's is `tmux`, so this adapter's "transport"
// is a subprocess behind an interface — the same shape `bridge/mux/tmux/exec.ts` has and for the same
// reason: the conformance fixture (fixture.ts) implements {@link ZellijExec} over an in-memory world,
// which is what lets the pure layer prove the WHOLE adapter — every argv it builds, every line it
// parses — on a box with no zellij installed (MUX_CONTRIBUTING.md § The two layers).
//
// TWO METHODS, BECAUSE ZELLIJ ANSWERS IN EXACTLY TWO WAYS. {@link run} is a one-shot
// `zellij … action …` that prints and exits; {@link stream} is the one long-lived verb,
// `zellij … subscribe`, which pushes newline-delimited JSON until it is killed (probed, M10/05).
//
// SPAWN HYGIENE, ADR 0015's pattern book, applied one for one:
//
//  • **No shell, ever.** Every call is an argv array through `Bun.spawn`, so a label, a pane name or
//    a message the operator typed is a single argument and never a fragment of a command line.
//  • **No PATH assumption.** The binary is resolved ONCE, from an explicit setting or by probing
//    fixed paths. A Herdr plugin action gets no login shell, so a bare `zellij` would resolve
//    differently under systemd than in the operator's terminal — memory `collie-herdr-action-env`
//    is that trap, already paid for once. zellij's own installer puts it in `~/.local/bin`, which is
//    why that path is first in the candidate list rather than a distro prefix.
//  • **The environment is inherited, and one variable in it is load-bearing.** zellij finds its
//    running sessions through a socket directory under `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`. Probed on zellij 0.44.2:
//    the same `list-sessions` run under `env -i` reported a LIVE session as `(EXITED …)`, and
//    reported it correctly again the moment `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` was put back. `Bun.spawn` passes this
//    process's environment through by default, so nothing here strips it — but an operator whose
//    collie sees every session as exited is looking at a unit file with no `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`.
//
// HOST-LOCAL BY RULE. Nothing here takes a machine address and nothing here may grow one: the
// endpoint is a session name on THIS box. Another machine is reached by talking to the Collie running
// on it (ADR 0011), never by teaching this file to reach across one.
