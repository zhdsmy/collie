// Neutral key spelling → zellij's `send-keys` grammar.
//
// The THIRD grammar of three, and the one that finally settles why the contract owns a neutral
// spelling at all (../keys.ts says so in its header). zellij joins a chord's parts with SPACES and
// capitalises each one — `"Ctrl a"`, `"Alt Shift b"`, `"Shift Tab"` — where Herdr joins with a `+`
// and tmux uses single-letter prefixes. None of the three is guessable from either of the others.
//
// The contract's spellings are deliberately absent from this file as STRINGS: they exist here only
// as the parsed {@link MuxKey} structure, so no translation can ever be a match on somebody else's
// grammar.
//
// ── WHAT ZELLIJ DOES WITH A NAME IT DOES NOT KNOW ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// It REFUSES, and that is a real difference from tmux worth writing down. Probed on 0.44.2:
// `send-keys "Nonsense"` answered `Invalid key at position 1: "Nonsense" / Error: unsupported key`
// and exited 2 — where tmux would have typed the word into the pane. So a typo in an operator's
// `keys.toml` row cannot reach a live agent as literal text through this adapter. The table below is
// still closed, because refusing BEFORE a process is spawned is better than refusing after, and
// because a closed table is what makes the `satisfies` check below possible.
//
// ── THE TWO NAMES ZELLIJ SPELLS DIFFERENTLY ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `Esc` (probed: `Escape` is rejected outright) and nothing else. Every other name in the contract's
// alphabet — including the paging and edit block Herdr refuses — was accepted verbatim, so zellij's
// `unsupportedKeys` holds no NAMED key.
//
// ── THE ONE CHORD ZELLIJ SENDS AS SOMETHING ELSE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `ctrl+Enter`. Probed 2026-10-08 on 0.44.2, in a throwaway session, against panes running `cat -v`
// in raw mode: `send-keys "Ctrl Enter"` exited 0 and arrived as `^M`, the same byte as Enter, both
// for a plain pane and for panes that had asked for the kitty keyboard protocol or modifyOtherKeys.
// So it is declared unsupported (../keys.ts `EXTENDED_ONLY_CHORDS`) and refused here: sent, it would
// be Enter, and Enter submits a draft in Claude Code's input box.
//
// ── WHY `meta` IS REFUSED, EVEN THOUGH ZELLIJ ACCEPTS `Super` ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// This is the trap this file exists to close. `send-keys "Super a"` exits 0 — and the pane receives
// a bare `a` (probed, with the character landing in a shell's input line). zellij parses the
// modifier and then drops it, because a PTY has no encoding for Super. Passing `meta` through would
// therefore turn "send Super+a" into "type a" at a live agent, silently. A refusal that says so is
// the only honest answer. It is not an `unsupportedKeys` entry because that list holds KEYS —
// enumerating every meta chord is not a list, and the Keys tray greys buttons off it.
