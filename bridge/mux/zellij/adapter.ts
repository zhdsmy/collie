// ZELLIJ, BEHIND THE CONTRACT — the third adapter, and the one that was supposed to break the seam.
//
// Everything above this file talks the mux port (../types.ts); everything below it — exec.ts,
// protocol.ts, session.ts, keys.ts, watch.ts — talks zellij. So this module is the whole
// translation, exactly as `herdr/adapter.ts` and `tmux/adapter.ts` are for theirs, and it is the only
// file holding both vocabularies at once.
//
// ── THE MAPPING, WRITTEN DOWN BECAUSE IT WILL BE RE-PROPOSED ─────────────────────────────────────
//
//   zellij session  →  Collie SPACE   (exactly one, {@link ZELLIJ_SPACE_ID})
//   zellij tab      →  Collie TAB     (`tab_3`, off zellij's stable `tab_id`)
//   zellij terminal →  Collie PANE    (`terminal_7`, zellij's own id, carried through unchanged)
//
// zellij has the same three levels tmux has, and the tempting move is therefore tmux's: session →
// space. It does not work, and the reason is a property of zellij's CLI rather than a preference.
// **Every zellij verb is scoped to ONE session**: `action` takes `--session`, `list-panes` lists that
// session's panes, and there is no verb that enumerates panes across sessions. An adapter instance is
// bound to one session (session.ts), so its world has exactly one space — and the space's id is a
// CONSTANT rather than the session's name, because a name is the one thing about a session that an
// operator could change and identity rule 2 says an id may not move under them.
//
// That single space is also why {@link ZellijMux.createSpace} is declared absent. zellij CAN create a
// detached session (`zellij attach --create-background`, probed) — and a session this adapter created
// would be invisible to the very adapter that made it, because the adapter only ever lists its own.
// Declaring the capability would put a button on the phone whose result never appears.
//
// ── WHAT ZELLIJ DOES NOT KNOW, SAID OUT LOUD ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// zellij has **no idea what an agent is**, exactly as tmux has none. `list-panes` reports a pane's
// title and its `terminal_command`, and neither is an answer: the title is whatever the pane was last
// named or last printed, and a wrong agent name picks a wrong harness grammar AND a wrong journal
// adapter. So `agentDetection` is declared absent and every pane reports `"shell"` / `"unknown"` —
// the contract's documented answer, and NOT a guess (../types.ts § MuxPane.agent). `agentSessionRef`
// follows: with no agent, there is no session an agent named, so pane transcript reading is declared
// ABSENT rather than served empty (M10/06 renders that).
//
// ── ONE TITLE SLOT, AND WHO GETS IT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// zellij has exactly one per-pane label — the listing's `title` — where the contract has two
// (`paneLabel`, the operator's, and `terminalTitle`, the program's). The probe found THREE things
// writing that one slot: `rename-pane`, the pane's launch command, and the pane's own printed title
// ("whatever the pane was last named or last printed"). Read as `paneLabel`, the last two are Collie
// telling the operator they named a pane they never touched.
//
// So the slot is split by MEMORY, exactly as tmux's is and for the same reason (MUX_CONTRACT.md
// § Contract-owned rules, *Pane naming*): {@link ZellijMux.ownLabels} holds the labels THIS adapter
// set through `renamePane`, and a title equal to the pane's remembered label comes back as
// `paneLabel`. Everything else in the slot comes back as `terminalTitle`. The memory is in-process,
// so a bridge restart degrades an operator's label to `terminalTitle` — visible, less prominent, and
// never a claim about who wrote it.
//
// zellij's own default for the slot is `Pane #N`, which is why {@link programTitle} drops it: an
// untouched pane says nothing at all.
//
// ── WHY EVERY WRITE TAKES A LISTING FIRST ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `zellij action` exits 0 whether or not the pane exists (probed — protocol.ts's header has the
// list). An exit code can therefore never prove `gone`, and the contract requires `gone` for a pane
// that has been closed while the operator's screen still shows it. So the adapter keeps its own
// short-lived census and checks the target against it: see {@link ZellijMux.livePane}.
