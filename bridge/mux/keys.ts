// THE NEUTRAL KEY SPELLING — Collie's own, owned by the contract, translated by every adapter.
//
// Three multiplexers, three grammars, and no two agree:
//
//   Collie (here)   ctrl+c      shift+Tab      alt+Up      a      Escape
//   Herdr           ctrl+c      shift+tab      alt+Up      a      Escape    (HERDR_API.md § key grammar)
//   tmux            C-c         BTab / S-Tab   M-Up        a      Escape    (probe, M10/04)
//   zellij          "Ctrl c"    "Alt Shift b"  —           a      Esc       (probe, M10/05)
//
// So a key name is a translation, and the contract owns the source language. It looks close to
// Herdr's because Herdr's is the most explicit of the three, and being close is worth a great deal
// to the reference adapter — but it is NOT Herdr's, on three deliberate points:
//
//  1. **The modifier is `meta`, never `cmd`/`super`.** One spelling for the one key; the adapter
//     picks whichever word its multiplexer answers to.
//  2. **The alphabet is closed and complete**, including the paging and edit keys Herdr refuses
//     outright (HERDR_API.md § key grammar: PageUp/PageDown/Home/End/Insert/Delete → `invalid_key`).
//     A key a multiplexer cannot send is declared in its capability declaration's `unsupportedKeys`,
//     not left out of the contract — otherwise the first adapter that CAN send Home would have to
//     widen the contract to say so.
//  3. **Modifier order is canonical** (`ctrl` `alt` `shift` `meta`), so two spellings of one chord
//     compare equal. Without that, an adapter's translation table has to be written per permutation
//     and a test comparing sent keys is a coin toss.
//
// The grammar itself: modifiers joined to the key with `+`, lower-case; the key is either one
// literal character (typed as itself — `a`, `A`, `1`, `+`) or one name from {@link MUX_NAMED_KEYS},
// which are CapitalCase. `ctrl+c`, `shift+Tab`, `ctrl+alt+Delete`, `F7`, `/`.
