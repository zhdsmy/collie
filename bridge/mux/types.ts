// THE MUX PORT — everything Collie needs from a multiplexer, in Collie's words.
//
// A *multiplexer* is what owns the pane. A *harness* is what runs inside it (claude, codex, pi, omp).
// Two axes, two registries, and they never key off each other — see registry.ts.
//
// WHY A PORT AND NOT A CLIENT. `bridge/types.ts` already decoupled the DOMAIN from Herdr's wire
// shapes ("These are OUR types … the rest of the app talks in these terms"), and the frontend holds
// no multiplexer vocabulary at all. What was missing is the other half: an INTERFACE the bridge
// depends on instead of a concrete class, so a second multiplexer is a module rather than a branch
// in every route. ADR 0022 records why "just point the Herdr client at it" is not that.
//
// THREE CONTRACT-OWNED THINGS LIVE HERE, because getting them wrong later is expensive:
//
//  • **The unsupported answer** ({@link MuxOutcome}) — one shape, distinguishable from a failure, so
//    a route never has to guess what a rejected call meant.
//  • **Identity** — see identity.ts. Stable across a reconnect, unique within a collie.
//  • **Subscription semantics** — see {@link MuxAdapter.watch}. The promise is the contract's; how
//    an adapter keeps it (a real stream, a poll, or a hybrid) is the adapter's.
//
// The neutral key spelling is the fourth (keys.ts), and the reason it exists is that all three
// multiplexers spell `ctrl+c` differently.
//
// WHAT IS NOT HERE, deliberately: a rendered terminal. `readGrid` returns text the multiplexer has
// ALREADY rendered, carrying colour and nothing else; Collie runs no emulator and never will
// (ADR 0008). An adapter whose multiplexer will not hand over a rendered screen declines the
// capability — it does not get a VT parser written for it.

 * Why a call did not happen. Four reasons, and the first one is not a failure at all:

 *  • `unsupported` — this multiplexer has no such thing, and never will while it is this
 *    multiplexer. The route renders an explanation, not an error (M10/06). It names the
 *    {@link MuxCapability} so the UI can reuse one wording rule instead of parsing prose.
 *  • `gone` — the pane or tab existed and does not any more. The operator's screen is stale; the
 *    remedy is to go back, not to retry.
 *  • `refused` — the multiplexer understood and said no (a key it will not send, a label it will
 *    not take). Retrying the same call gets the same answer.
 *  • `unreachable` — the multiplexer did not answer. This is the only one worth retrying, and it is
 *    what drives the connected/disconnected banner.
 *
 * An adapter MUST return this rather than throw for anything it declared absent — that is checked by
 * conformance (M10/03), because a throw is what forces every route to guess.

 * The adapter's plain DATA fields, carried across a decorator unchanged.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A FUNCTION AND NOT THREE LINES IN EACH WRAPPER. Both decorators (beacon/decorate.ts,
 * beacon/hint.ts) rebuild the adapter as an object literal that names every field — they cannot
 * spread it, because an adapter written as a class keeps its methods on a prototype. That shape has
 * one failure mode and it is silent: a new field on {@link MuxAdapter} is simply not mentioned, so
 * it survives every test that talks to a raw adapter and vanishes the moment the real bridge wraps
 * one. `logo` did exactly that, on all three live instances, while the unit tests stayed green.
 *
 * So the data fields are gathered HERE, once, and each decorator spreads the result. Adding a field
 * to the contract is then one edit in this file rather than three that nothing forces you to make —
 * and `decorate.test.ts`'s surface tripwire fails if the next one is added anywhere else.
 *
 * Methods stay out of it deliberately: a decorator delegating a verb is a decision it makes verb by
 * verb (it may wrap one), whereas data has nothing to decide.
 *
 * The field is OMITTED rather than set to `undefined` when the adapter has none, so
 * `"logo" in adapter` keeps answering the same question after wrapping as before it.
