// THE AGENT NAMES THE CONTRACT ACCEPTS — a contract rule, like the key spelling in keys.ts.
//
// `MuxPane.agent` picks two things above the seam: the phone's screen reader for the pane
// (web/src/lib/harness/registry.ts) and the bridge's journal reader for its history
// (bridge/journal/registry.ts). Both look the name up EXACTLY. So a multiplexer's own id for a
// harness (tuios says `claude-code`, where Collie says `claude`) reaches neither reader, and the
// pane is rendered raw with its prompts unread. Nothing used to say so: the conformance suite only
// asked for a lower-cased, non-empty name.
//
// The rule: an agent name is `shell` or one of the names below. An adapter translates its own ids
// into these, and an agent Collie has no harness for reads as a shell. The list is the union of the
// two registries plus the journal's aliases, and `agents.test.ts` fails when it drifts from them.
