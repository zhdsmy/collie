// Pane and space IDENTITY — a contract rule, not an adapter's private business.
//
// It is here because it is the one thing that is expensive to get wrong later: an id that changes
// under the operator invalidates a per-pane draft, an open pane view, a notification, an audit line
// and (in a crew) a `(host, session, paneId)` address. Nothing above the adapter can repair that, so
// the rules are stated once and every adapter is held to them by conformance (M10/03).
//
// THE RULES
//
//  1. **Opaque above the adapter.** Only the adapter that minted an id may parse it. Nothing else
//     may read structure into it — not the routes, not the phone, not a test. Herdr's `w6:p3`,
//     tmux's `%0` and zellij's `terminal_1` are three different shapes and that is fine.
//  2. **Stable while the pane lives.** The same pane keeps its id across a reconnect of the adapter,
//     a restart of the multiplexer process, a rename, and a move between tabs or spaces. An id
//     derived from anything the operator can change (a label, a title, a position) breaks this.
//  3. **Unique within one collie.** Across every space and tab of the configured target. NOT across
//     machines — a crew address is `(host, session, paneId)` and the host half is the lead's job
//     (CREW_PROTOCOL.md §4), so an adapter must not try to make its ids globally unique.
//  4. **Never recycled onto a different pane** for the lifetime of the bridge process. A
//     multiplexer that reuses a slot number must salt it; answering for the wrong pane is worse
//     than answering "gone".
//  5. **Transport-safe.** An id travels as a single URL path segment (`/api/pane/:id`), as a cache
//     key on the phone, and inside a JSON body. {@link isValidMuxId} is that rule, mechanically.
//
// Rule 5 is checkable here and now; rules 1–4 are behavioural and are pinned by the conformance
// suite. Both halves are the contract.

 * `decodeURIComponent`, and a segment that has to be split or re-joined to survive that round trip
 * will eventually not survive it.
 *
 * `%` is deliberately ALLOWED, and the reason is rule 1: tmux's own stable pane id is `%0` (probe,
 * M10/04). Percent-encoding handles it — an id that had to be re-encoded to be carried would stop
 * being the multiplexer's id, which is the property rule 2 rests on.
