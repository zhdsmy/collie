// TMUX'S CONFORMANCE FIXTURE — what lets the tmux adapter be proved on a box with no tmux.
//
// NOT a production module and not imported by one. `registry.ts` builds `TmuxMux` over a
// {@link SpawnTmuxExec}; this file builds the SAME adapter over a fake of the same shape, so the
// conformance engine (../conformance.ts) drives the whole translation — every argv the adapter
// composes, every `-F` format it asks for, the key table, the refusal mapping, the control-mode
// parsing — without a subprocess.
//
// THE FAKE IS ARGV-DRIVEN, AND THAT IS THE POINT. It does not stub the adapter's methods; it reads
// the command line the adapter actually built, splits it on tmux's `;` exactly as tmux does, and
// renders `-F` formats by interpreting the format string it was handed. So a field the adapter stops
// asking for stops arriving, and a format token nobody teaches this file renders empty — which is
// what the real binary does for an unknown `#{…}`.
//
// A FAKE THAT IS KINDER THAN THE REAL BINARY PROVES NOTHING, so every answer below was probed on
// tmux 3.6b (M10/04):
//   • an unknown target answers `can't find pane: %999` on stderr with exit 1 — the sentence the
//     adapter turns into the contract's `gone`;
//   • a duplicate session name answers `duplicate session: <name>` — a `refused`, not a `gone`;
//   • `capture-pane -e` carries SGR and nothing else, and without `-e` carries none, so the
//     contract's `styling` request is a real branch;
//   • `-S -N` reaches behind the viewport and a plain capture does not;
//   • pane ids are `%N` from a counter that only ever climbs, so a dead pane's id is never reused —
//     the tmux promise identity rule 4 rests on, and the fake would be lying if it recycled them.
