// THE THINGS CONFORMANCE CANNOT ASK FOR, pinned here on the real adapter over the real fake.
//
// Conformance (../conformance.test.ts) drives every capability of this adapter already — including
// the contract's *Pane naming* rule, which the world contract CAN express (a program printing a
// title is a perturbation). What it has no vocabulary for is what that rule costs on tmux
// specifically — a title outliving its program, and a label outliving the process that remembers it
// — plus a hazard that belongs to ONE multiplexer's binary and a transport that dies mid-call:
//
//  • **The #4849 spawn guard.** tmux ≤ 3.6b segfaults its whole SERVER when it spawns a window while
//    the global `window-size` is `manual` — so the interesting assertion is that the argv was never
//    issued, which is a question about tmux's own option and no other adapter's.
//  • **Transport death.** The contract owns the rule (`unreachable`, never `refused` —
//    MUX_CONTRACT.md § Contract-owned rules), but the WORLD contract has no perturbation for it:
//    `reconnect()` models a socket that was already gone, and teaching every fixture in the registry
//    to kill a live transport mid-call would push a tmux-shaped fault onto Herdr and zellij, whose
//    transports fail in their own words. So it is pinned here, per-adapter, and the rule lives in the
//    contract for the next adapter to meet the same way.
