// HOW THE TMUX ADAPTER TALKS TO TMUX — one narrow seam, and the only file that spawns a process.
//
// tmux has no socket protocol a client can speak; the client IS the `tmux` binary. So this adapter's
// "transport" is a subprocess, and it is behind an interface for exactly the reason `HerdrRpc` is:
// the conformance fixture (fixture.ts) implements {@link TmuxExec} over an in-memory world, which is
// what lets the pure layer prove the WHOLE adapter — every argv it builds, every stderr it reads —
// on a box with no tmux installed (MUX_CONTRIBUTING.md § The two layers).
//
// SPAWN HYGIENE, ADR 0015's pattern book, applied one for one:
//
//  • **No shell, ever.** Every call is an argv array through `Bun.spawn`, so a pane title, a label or
//    a message the operator typed is a single argument and never a fragment of a command line. There
//    is no interpolation anywhere in this adapter.
//  • **No PATH assumption.** The binary is resolved ONCE, from an explicit setting or by probing
//    fixed paths (`[ -x ]`, in ADR 0015's words). A Herdr plugin action gets no login shell, so a
//    bare `tmux` would resolve differently under systemd than in the operator's terminal — memory
//    `collie-herdr-action-env` is that trap, already paid for once.
//  • **Secrets and long payloads ride stdin.** Literal text is written to a tmux paste buffer over
//    stdin rather than passed as an argument: it dodges `MAX_ARG_STRLEN` (128 KiB per argv element on
//    Linux — a long reply would simply fail) and it dodges tmux's own argument lexer, which eats a
//    trailing `;` as a command separator (probed, M10/04).
//
// HOST-LOCAL BY RULE. Nothing here takes a host and nothing here may grow one: `-L`/`-S` name a
// socket on THIS machine's filesystem. A remote tmux is reached by talking to the Collie running on
// that machine (ADR 0011), never by teaching this file to reach across one.
