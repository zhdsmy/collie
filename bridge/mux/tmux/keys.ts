// Neutral key spelling → tmux's `send-keys` grammar.
//
// A REAL translation table, unlike Herdr's, and the reason the contract owns the neutral spelling at
// all (../keys.ts says so in its header). tmux spells a chord `C-c`, a shifted Tab `BTab` and a page
// key `PPage`; none of that is guessable from the neutral spelling of the same three chords, and
// the neutral spelling is deliberately absent from this file as a STRING — it exists here only as the
// parsed {@link MuxKey} structure, so no translation can ever be a match on somebody else's grammar.
//
// THE TABLE IS CLOSED, AND THAT IS A SAFETY PROPERTY, NOT TIDINESS. Probed on tmux 3.6b: a key name
// tmux does not recognise is **typed as literal text** — `send-keys -t %6 Nonsense` put the word
// "Nonsense" in the shell's input line, exit code 0. So a pass-through translation would silently
// convert a typo in an operator's `keys.toml` row into eight characters typed at a live agent. Every
// spelling below is one tmux answered to in the probe; anything outside the table is `refused`
// before a process is spawned.
//
// WHAT TMUX CAN SEND THAT HERDR CANNOT. The paging and edit block — `PageUp`, `PageDown`, `Home`,
// `End`, `Insert`, `Delete` — are all real tmux keys (`PPage`, `NPage`, `Home`, `End`, `IC`, `DC`),
// so tmux sends every NAMED key where Herdr refuses six. That asymmetry is the whole argument for the
// contract's alphabet being closed and complete rather than Herdr's (../keys.ts).
//
// WHAT TMUX SENDS AS SOMETHING ELSE is `ctrl+Enter`. Probed 2026-10-08 on tmux 3.6b against a pane
// running `cat -v` in raw mode: `send-keys C-Enter` arrived as `^M`, the same byte as Enter, with
// `extended-keys` off and with `extended-keys always` + `extended-keys-format csi-u`. So it is
// declared unsupported (../keys.ts `EXTENDED_ONLY_CHORDS`) and refused here: sent, it would be Enter,
// and Enter submits a draft in Claude Code's input box.
//
// WHAT TMUX HAS NO WORD FOR is the `meta` modifier. tmux's `M-` is Alt, which the contract already
// spells `alt`; there is no second modifier to map `meta` onto, and mapping it onto `M-` would send
// Alt where the operator asked for Super/Command. A `meta` chord is therefore `refused` at send time
// with a reason that says so. It is not an `unsupportedKeys` entry because that list holds KEYS —
// enumerating every `meta+<anything>` chord is not a list, and the Keys tray greys buttons off it.
