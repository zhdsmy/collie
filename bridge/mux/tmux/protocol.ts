// TMUX'S OWN VOCABULARY — the argv this adapter builds and the text tmux answers with.
//
// Pure, so every format string, every parse and every error classification below is proved by the
// conformance fixture with no tmux installed. Nothing here knows the mux port; adapter.ts is the one
// file holding both vocabularies at once (the same split Herdr's client.ts / adapter.ts has).
//
// THE ONE LISTING CALL. tmux's `-F` format language means the adapter asks for exactly the fields the
// contract wants instead of parsing a human table, and tmux takes several commands in ONE invocation
// — so the whole snapshot is a single spawn whose three sections tag themselves:
//
//   tmux list-sessions -F 'S␟…' ; list-windows -a -F 'W␟…' ; list-panes -a -F 'P␟…'
//
// The separator is U+001F UNIT SEPARATOR, chosen because the free-text fields (a window name, a pane
// title, a working directory) can carry anything a user can type, and `|`, tab and space are all
// things a user types. It is not a proof — a program CAN emit U+001F into its own title — so the
// free-text fields are LAST in every record and the parser folds any excess back into the final
// field rather than mis-binding the fixed ones.
//
// Probed first-hand against tmux 3.6b on a throwaway server (`tmux -L collieprobe`, M10/04).

 * adapter was probed on — does not, which is why this went unseen until a tmux 3.4 herd parsed to
 * ZERO rows at exit code 0: every line failed the split, the bridge stored an empty herd and still

 * separator is the one sequence the parse cannot survive without.
 *
 * Two guards keep an honest field safe. A line that already carries the raw byte came from a tmux
 * that is NOT escaping, so a literal `\037` in a title there is the operator's own text and stays.
 * And on an escaping tmux a real backslash arrives doubled, so only an ODD run of backslashes is
