// The mux registry — the SINGLE decision site for "which multiplexer is this collie driving".
//
// Maps a configured mux name to the factory that builds its adapter. Adding a multiplexer is one
// entry in {@link MUX_ADAPTERS} plus its module — never a new branch in a route, a loader or an
// `if (mux === "herdr")` anywhere above this line.
//
// ⚠️ THIS IS NOT THE HARNESS SEAM, AND IT IS NOT THE JOURNAL SEAM. There are three axes in this
// codebase and they must not be conflated or keyed off one another:
//
//   • **harness** (`web/src/lib/harness/registry.ts`) — WHAT RUNS IN A PANE. Block grammars and the
//     send guard for the live mirror: claude, codex, pi, omp.
//   • **journal** (`bridge/journal/registry.ts`) — READING THAT AGENT'S OWN LOG off disk.
//   • **mux** (here) — WHAT OWNS THE PANE. Herdr, tmux, zellij.
//
// A harness is what runs *in* a pane; a mux is what the pane *is*. They cross at exactly one point,
// and it is named rather than assumed: a pane's agent-session reference is a declared mux capability
// (`agentSessionRef`), and the journal axis consumes it. A capability question must never be
// answered by a harness lookup, and a harness question must never be answered by the mux name — do
// that and neither axis is pluggable any more.
