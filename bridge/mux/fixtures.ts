// THE CONFORMANCE FIXTURE REGISTRY — the second half of what registering an adapter means.
//
// `registry.ts` says which multiplexers this build can DRIVE. This says how each of them is PROVED:
// one {@link MuxConformanceFixture} per registered adapter, and `conformance.test.ts` fails an
// adapter that has none. Two lists rather than one field on the factory, because a fixture pulls in a
// fake transport and a seeded world — none of which belongs in the module the bridge starts from.
//
// Adding tmux (M10/04) or zellij (M10/05) is therefore exactly two lines: its factory in
// `MUX_ADAPTERS`, its fixture here. No new test file, ever — the suite iterates.
//
// ── THE DECORATED VARIANTS (M11/03) ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// What actually runs on a tmux or zellij host is the adapter WITH the beacon decorator around it, so
// that build gets the whole suite too — twice, because the decorator's honesty runs in two
// directions and each has its own way of being wrong:
//
//   • hooks INSTALLED ⇒ `agentDetection` / `agentSessionRef` are declared, and the suite's
//     `declaredPaneFactsArePopulated` demands that a pane really names an agent and carries a session.
//   • hooks ABSENT ⇒ both stay absent, and `undeclaredPaneFactsAreAbsent` demands every pane read as
//     a shell of unknown status with no session — the same calls, answering honestly the other way.
//
// The beacons are seeded BESIDE the fake transport, keyed off the ids of the world the fake actually
// built rather than off hard-coded pane names: the join is the thing under test, so a fixture that
// asserted its own ids would be proving its own arithmetic. Nothing here needs Claude, tmux, zellij
// or a state directory.
