// What a multiplexer adapter DECLARES it can do — the vocabulary a route asks in, so that no route
// ever asks "is this Herdr".
//
// EVERY NAME BELOW WAS DERIVED FROM A ROUTE, NOT IMAGINED. The trace is in
// {@link MUX_CAPABILITY_ROUTES} and it is part of the contract: a capability with no route behind it
// is a capability nothing can consume, and a route whose only backing is "Herdr has always done it"
// is the bug this seam exists to prevent. When a new route needs something a multiplexer might not
// have, the capability is added here WITH its route — see MUX_CONTRACT.md for the matrix.
//
// Two things are deliberately NOT capabilities:
//
//  • **The floor.** Listing panes/spaces/tabs and answering "are you reachable" are not declarable.
//    An adapter that cannot do those is not an adapter — there is nothing for Collie to render.
//  • **Image upload** (`POST /api/pane/:id/upload`). Read the route: it takes `cfg` and never the
//    multiplexer (bridge/server.ts `uploadPane`). It writes a file to the bridge host's disk and
//    hands back a path the operator pastes; the multiplexer is not involved, so it cannot decline it.
//    It is host-local for every adapter because a mux adapter is host-local by rule (ADR 0011).
