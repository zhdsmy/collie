//   • releaseAvailable — is a newer Collie RELEASE published upstream? We read the repo's git tags
//     over anonymous HTTPS (the repo is public) and compare the newest `vX.Y.Z` to the running
//     version. No `git` subprocess (the SSH origin has no agent under systemd --user, and a
//     non-git install has no origin at all), no auth (the 60/hr anonymous limit is irrelevant at a
//     few-hours cadence), and the fetch is trivially injectable for `bun test`.
//   • bridgeStale — is the running bridge PROCESS behind the on-disk bridge source? The frontend
//     build id can't answer this (it's read fresh from disk, so a stale bridge reports the NEW
//     bundle). We stamp the bridge sources at process start and compare; a rebuilt-but-not-restarted
//     bridge (the "#1 my change didn't take" trap) then reads as stale.
//
// The pure pieces (semver compare, tag selection, notify gating, the source stamp) are exported and
// unit-tested; the network + filesystem live behind injected seams on {@link UpdateMonitor}, matching
