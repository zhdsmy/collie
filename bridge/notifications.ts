// A notification shouldn't be fire-and-forget. This coordinator gives every blocked/done alert a
// lifecycle and collapses the herd into a single, always-accurate notification:
//
//   • Debounce + cancel — an agent that blocks and unblocks within the window (you handled it at your
//     desk) never reaches your phone. Herdr exposes no "user present" signal (only a `focused` pane,
//     no activity timestamp), so we infer presence: a quickly-resolved transition is an at-desk one.
//   • Coalesce — instead of N stacked notifications, we keep ONE summary of everything currently
//     outstanding: the named agent when exactly one needs you, or "N agents need you" for several.
//     Each change re-renders that single summary; when the last one resolves, we clear it.
//   • Retract — clearing an agent at the PC (or its pane closing) updates or removes the summary, so
//     handled work never lingers on your lock screen.
//
// Pure and clock-injected so `bun test` drives it without real timers: the bridge passes
// setTimeout/clearTimeout (see server.ts); tests pass a fake clock they fire on demand.
