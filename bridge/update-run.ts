// The update RUN record: `<state dir>/update.json`, written by the detached updater and read by

//
// ── WHY THE SHAPE LIVES IN `bridge/` ─────────────────────────────────────────
// The writer is `cli/update-run.ts` and the readers are the bridge's update snapshot and the standby
// door. `cli/` may import from `bridge/`; nothing in `bridge/` may import from `cli/`. So the record,
// its parser and the staleness rule live here — the same reason `bridge/version.ts` owns the version
// string both sides print. One definition, never two that agree today.
//
// ── WHY THERE IS A FILE AT ALL ───────────────────────────────────────────────
// An update restarts the bridge, so the process that reports on it cannot be the process being
// restarted. The runner writes; the bridge reads at startup and reports what it finds, instead of
// coming up `idle` and telling the phone nothing happened. That symptom — tap update, the app goes
// blank, comes back claiming there was no update — is the whole reason this file is on disk.
