// THE HOST GUARD (M43 spec 11). Source that runs on Windows reads its path flavour and its binary
// name from the `Host` object in `bridge/host.ts`. These four spellings are how that rule gets
// broken without anyone noticing, because each one is right on Linux and silently wrong on Windows:
//
//   startsWith("/")        a Windows folder starts with `C:\`, never with a slash
//   new URL(...).pathname  a file URL's pathname is `/C:/x` on Windows; `fileURLToPath` is the answer
//   .split("/")            a Windows path splits at backslashes too
//   "bin", "collie"        the binary is `collie.exe` there; `collieBinary(root, host)` names it
//
// A new hit fails the test. The fix is one of two things: read the host (`host.path`, `isInside`,
// `collieBinary`), or, when Windows never reaches the line, add it to NOT_REACHED_BY_WINDOWS with the
// reason in one line. The two lists carry a count per file, so a site that is removed also fails
// the test until its entry goes: the lists cannot rot into a blanket permission.
