// What this machine is doing right now: CPU, memory and network, sampled from the existing tick.
//
// ── PURE PARSERS, ONE READER, NO CHILD PROCESS ───────────────────────────────
// Every number comes from a file the kernel already keeps or from `node:os`, never from `top`, `ps`,
// `vm_stat` or `typeperf`. A spawn on the poll path would cost more than the reading is worth, and
// Collie runs no long-lived child for content (CLAUDE.md, Security posture). The parsers below take
// text and return numbers, and the one reader takes its file and `os` access as parameters, so
// `bun test` drives a Linux, a macOS-like and a Windows-like host on any machine.
//
// ── WHY LINUX READS /proc/stat AND NOT os.cpus() ─────────────────────────────
// Measured on 2026-10-05 under Bun 1.4.1 on Fedora (16 cores): `os.cpus()` reports `user`, `nice`,
// `sys`, `idle` and `irq` per core, each exactly ten times the matching `/proc/stat` column. It leaves
// out `iowait`, `softirq` and `steal`. Over three seconds of an idle desktop those columns held 11 %
// of all time, so the busy fraction from `os.cpus()` read 12.4 % where `/proc/stat` read 11.3 %, and
// the gap grows with disk wait. So Linux reads the aggregate `cpu` line and counts `iowait` as idle,
// the way `top` does. Every other platform sums `os.cpus()`, which is all it offers without a spawn.
//
// ── NO TIMER, AND A SLOW BASE RATE ───────────────────────────────────────────
// {@link MachineSampler.tick} is called from the state engine's tick (CREW_PROTOCOL.md §10.1, §11:
// no second timer). It reads at most once every {@link SAMPLE_IDLE_MS}, and at most once every
// {@link SAMPLE_WATCHED_MS} while a phone has asked for the Machines list in the last
// `MACHINES_WATCH_MS` (`bridge/machines.ts`): the same intent-driven idea as the poll cadence, so a
// bridge nobody looks at reads its machine a third as often. The alerts judge minute buckets, and
// the idle arithmetic is in `machines.ts` beside the watch. A crew snapshot answer never reads
// anything: it serves {@link MachineSampler.latest}, the last sample held.
//
// ── DISKS RIDE ALONG, ASYNC ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A sample carries the last answer of `DiskWatch` (bridge/machine-disks.ts), which this tick starts
// at most once a minute and never waits for: a `statfs` on a hung mount must not hold the tick.
//
// ── WHAT ONE SAMPLE COSTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Measured on 2026-10-05 under Bun 1.4.1 on a 16-core Fedora desktop with 33 network interfaces
// (Docker): about 0.2 ms, almost all of it in the kernel producing the three files (`/proc/net/dev`
// about 0.11 ms, `/proc/stat` 0.03 ms, `/proc/meminfo` 0.01 ms). The parsers below cost about 0.01 ms
// together, because each walks only the lines it needs. Linux takes its core count from the `cpuN`
// lines of `/proc/stat`, which it reads anyway, and never calls `os.cpus()`. Reading
// `/sys/class/net/<iface>/statistics` instead of `/proc/net/dev` was measured too, and was no cheaper.
