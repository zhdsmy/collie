// This collie's own version string, resolved from the same two files for every consumer.
//
// It lives in `bridge/` rather than in `cli/` because the dependency direction is one-way — `cli/`
// imports from `bridge/` (context.ts already does, for `config.ts` and `root.ts`) and nothing in
// `bridge/` may import from `cli/`. `hello` has to answer with a version (PACK_PROTOCOL.md §7.1,
// "Where the responder gets the string"), and the spec's requirement is that the bridge and the CLI
// "never print different strings for one machine" — which is only guaranteed by one implementation,
// not by two that agree today. `cli/context.ts` re-exports {@link collieVersion} from here.
//
// TWO SPELLINGS, deliberately:
//   • {@link collieVersion} — what `collie version` PRINTS. May carry a parenthetical
//     ("0.24.2 (manifest; web not built)"): it is a sentence for an operator.
//   • {@link collieVersionBare} — what goes ON THE WIRE. A version and nothing else, because the
//     other side compares it against its own and renders the difference (§7.1); a parenthetical
//     would make one machine skewed against itself the moment its web bundle was missing.
// Both read the same files through the same judgement, so they can differ in decoration and never
// in the version they name.

 * onto a staged version. Both are comparing a string a running Collie ANSWERS with against a version
 * and a commit, and both learned the same lesson: a built Collie reports `<semver>+<short sha>`, so
 * comparing against the bare semver reports a mismatch about a machine running exactly the right
 * code.
 *
 * The build metadata is compared as an ABBREVIATION of the commit rather than byte for byte: git
 * chooses that length per repository, so the other build may spell the same commit with more digits
 * than this one does — and it stays a mismatch the moment the digits disagree, or a `-dirty`/`-dev`
 * marker says the build is not that commit. A Collie with no build stamp at all can only report its
 * manifest version; that is the version it was given, and it is not evidence against the build.
