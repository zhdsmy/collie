//
// ── WHY THE BRIDGE RE-DERIVES THE PREFLIGHT SHAPE ────────────────────────────
// The report is produced by `collie update --check --json` (cli/update-check.ts, schema 1). `cli/`
// may import from `bridge/`; nothing in `bridge/` may import from `cli/` — the direction rule stated
// in `bridge/update-run.ts`'s header. So the bridge does what it does with every other foreign
// document: it declares the shape it will believe and parses defensively. This is the same
// arrangement `bridge/json.ts` and `web/src/lib/json.ts` already live with, one boundary further
// out: the producer is a SUBPROCESS, so the two sides could not share a type even if the import
// direction allowed it. {@link PREFLIGHT_SCHEMA} is the version that keeps them honest — a report
// from a schema this build does not know is declined rather than half-read.
//
// ── WHY THE VERDICT IS A PURE FUNCTION ───────────────────────────────────────
// The handler lives inside `Bun.serve`, which `bun test` cannot stand up (CLAUDE.md). Every refusal
// this route can make is therefore decided by {@link updateStartVerdict}, which takes plain values
// and answers a plain value; `bridge/server.ts` renders it. The gate is the one thing NOT decided
// here — it is the pane path's own `guard(req, cfg, "write", pairing)` closure, handed in, so the
// two can never drift into two different answers to the same question (spec 05).

 * runner (M15/04). The bridge adds nothing to that path and knows nothing about it.
 *
 * **What it does add is one hop out of its own cgroup.** `collie update` stages first and hands off
 * second, and the handoff is what restarts this very service — so a staging child left inside the
 * bridge's unit would be killed by the restart it asked for. `systemd-run --user --collect` asks the
 * user manager to run the staging in a transient unit of its own, and it is that UNIT which sits
 * outside this cgroup; the `systemd-run` client stays a member of it until it exits, which is the
 * distinction the handoff inside `collie update` has to honour in turn
 * ([ADR 0037](../.adr/0037-a-staged-update-confirms-its-runner-before-it-exits.md)). `setsid` at
 * least leaves the process group where there is no user manager; a bare spawn is the last resort on
 * a host with neither. That ladder is deliberately the same three tiers as `cli/update-run.ts`'s
 * `launchPlan`, for the same reasons written there — it is restated rather than imported because
 * nothing in `bridge/` may import from `cli/`.
 *
 * **`detach` is the spawn's own `setsid()`, and it is on for every tier but `systemd-run`** (#213).
 * macOS has neither `systemd-run` nor a `setsid` binary, so the bare tier used to leave the runner in
 * the launchd job's process group; `collie update` then boots that job out to restart it, launchd
 * kills the whole group, and the `bootstrap` that should follow never runs. The systemd-run tier
 * stays attached on purpose: its client must stay a member of this cgroup until the manager answers
 * (ADR 0037), and systemd kills by cgroup, not by process group, so a new session would buy nothing.
