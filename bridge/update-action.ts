// ── WHY THE BRIDGE RE-DERIVES THE PREFLIGHT SHAPE ────────────────────────────
// The report is produced by `collie update --check --json` (cli/update-check.ts, schema 1). `cli/`
// may import from `bridge/`; nothing in `bridge/` may import from `cli/` — the direction rule stated
// in `bridge/update-run.ts`'s header. So the bridge does what it does with every other foreign
// document: it declares the shape it will believe and parses defensively. This is the same
// arrangement `bridge/json.ts` and `web/src/lib/json.ts` already live with, one boundary further
// out: the producer is a SUBPROCESS, so the two sides could not share a type even if the import
// direction allowed it. {@link PREFLIGHT_SCHEMA} is the version that keeps them honest — a report
// from a schema this build does not know is declined rather than half-read.
//
// ── WHY THE VERDICT IS A PURE FUNCTION ───────────────────────────────────────
// The handler lives inside `Bun.serve`, which `bun test` cannot stand up (CLAUDE.md). Every refusal
// this route can make is therefore decided by {@link updateStartVerdict}, which takes plain values
// and answers a plain value; `bridge/server.ts` renders it. The gate is the one thing NOT decided
// here — it is the pane path's own `guard(req, cfg, "write", pairing)` closure, handed in, so the
// two can never drift into two different answers to the same question (spec 05).

 *     refusal too: "we could not check" is not "nothing is red".
 *  4. **The major crossing.** Asked for by name and consented to by name, or refused with the words
 *     that say so. It must not be possible to cross a major by tapping the button you tapped last
 *     week.
