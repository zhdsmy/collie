// ── SECRETS ARE MASKED BEFORE PANE TEXT LEAVES THE MACHINE ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// A MITIGATION, NOT A GUARANTEE. Text a pane shows can hold a secret: an `env` dump, a `cat .env`,
// a curl line with a bearer token, a key an agent echoed back. Every path that carries that text
// toward a phone runs it through this module first: the terminal mirror, the journal reader's Chat
// and History bodies (`journal/text.ts` § redactEntry), every push payload (`push.ts` § Push.send),
// and file content: the Changes view's diffs and the Files view's file bodies. The per-answer masks
// live in `answer-mask.ts`, shared by this bridge's own routes and by a crew lead re-masking what a
// member sent (`crew/mask.ts`). One pattern list serves them all, so a shape caught in one place is
// caught in every one. Every mask is idempotent: `MASK` matches no pattern, so masked text masks to
// itself, which is what lets a lead mask an answer a member may already have masked.
//
// ── ONLY HIGH-CONFIDENCE SHAPES ──────────────────────────────────────────────
// The list below matches shapes that are secrets by construction: a vendor prefix that exists only
// on keys, a JWT, a PEM private key block, a bearer token, and a value written beside a name that
// says "password", "secret", "token" or "api key". It deliberately MISSES:
//
//   • plain passwords typed or printed on their own (no shape tells "hunter2" from a word),
//   • bare hex and base64 (a git sha, a content hash and a checksum all look like a key),
//   • a key whose vendor prefix is not in the list, and a value split across two `key=` lines.
//
// A pattern for those would mask ordinary text and code on every screen, which makes the mirror
// useless and teaches the operator to switch this off. Known false positives, accepted: a
// `token: <8+ chars>` line of prose or YAML that is not a secret is masked anyway, and a long
// `sk-…` CSS class or slug would be too.
//
// ── THE MASK KEEPS THE LAYOUT ────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A match is replaced character for character by `•`, so a row keeps its width and the mirror's
// columns hold; a PEM block keeps its line count. A vendor-prefixed key and a JWT keep their first
// four characters (`sk-o••••`, `AKIA••••`), which are the vendor's constant prefix and carry no
// entropy, so the operator still sees WHAT was masked. A bearer token and a `key=value` value are
// masked whole. Every pattern matches printable ASCII only, so one character is one column. On the
// mirror a secret the terminal wrapped at the pane's edge is found across the wrap and masked on both
// rows (see `findSpans`).
//
// The audit trail has its own, different redaction (`audit.ts`), and what the operator SENDS
// (replies, keys) is never touched here: this is only about text going out to a phone.
//
// ── COST ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The mirror is polled every 1.5 s per open pane. Each pattern opens on a literal prefix and has no
// nested quantifier, so a scan is linear in the text; a screen with no match allocates nothing.
// `redact.test.ts` pins a 200 × 200 screen under 20 ms.
//
// The switch is `COLLIE_REDACT` (`[access] redact`), default on (`config.ts`).
