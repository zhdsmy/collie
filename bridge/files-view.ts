// THE FILES VIEW'S BRIDGE HALF — one folder listed, or one text file read, under the Changes root
// (ADR 0083), or one picture read as bytes (ADR 0090, {@link readImage}). Read-only by construction: nothing here writes, renames, creates or deletes. The one
// child process is `git check-ignore`, once per listing, through Changes' hardened runner, with the
// names on stdin and no flags at all when git does not answer ({@link gitIgnoredNames}). A third
// call only asks whether paths exist, for the links in the pane view (ADR 0088): the same checks as
// a read, then one `lstat` per path, and nothing opened ({@link existingPaths}).
//
// ── THE THIRD PLACE A CLIENT VALUE BECOMES A PATH ───────────────────────────────────────────────
// The law in bridge/journal/files.ts names three places, and this is the third. Its bound:
//
//   1. The ROOT is never the client's. It is the folder bridge/changes-root.ts picks off the live
//      snapshot for the pane's workspace (the mux's folder, else the panes' common folder), or the
//      asking pane's own cwd when that passes the same `withinBound`. The root's REAL path must pass
//      `withinBound` too, against home's real path, so a workspace folder that is a symlink to `/` or
//      to home is `no-folder` and not the whole disk.
//   2. The client names a path RELATIVE to that root, and it is refused on its shape before any disk
//      call ({@link parseRelPath}): absolute, a `..` or `.` segment, an empty segment, NUL, a
//      backslash, more than 4096 bytes; on Windows also a colon, a wildcard, a trailing dot or space,
//      and a reserved device name.
//   3. The real path of the target must lie inside the real path of the root, through
//      `containedRealpath` (the shared one, host-aware). A symlink that leads out is refused on read
//      and still listed as `link`.
//   4. Denied for list and read alike, and hidden from listings: a `.git` segment, anything inside
//      the bridge's own state folder or config folder, and a file whose basename is a state secret's
//      (`crew-trust.json`, `paired-devices.json`, ..., `isStateSecretName` in bridge/acl-policy.ts),
//      wherever it sits, because a root can hold a SIBLING instance's state folder. All are checked on
//      the requested segments AND on the real path, and case-folded on every host, so `.GIT`, a
//      Windows `.git.`, a link into the state folder, or a link named `notes` that leads to a
//      sibling's `PAIRED-DEVICES.json` all land on the same refusal. A sibling's config `.env` and
//      every other credential file under the root are NOT covered (ADR 0083).
//
// Every refusal is the same answer, `unknown-path`: absent, outside, denied, a folder read as a file
// and a file listed as a folder cannot be told apart by anything the client sees.
//
// ── THE RACE, AND THE CHECK ON THE OPENED FILE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Between the containment check and the read, a path component can be swapped for a symlink. The
// final component is opened with O_NOFOLLOW (POSIX) so a swap of the file itself fails the open,
// O_NONBLOCK so a FIFO swapped in cannot hang the request, and the opened handle must be a regular
// file. A swap of a folder ABOVE it would still open a file elsewhere, so containment is checked a
// SECOND time, on the handle, before a byte is read ({@link openedFileAllowed}):
//   - Linux: the kernel's own name for the open file (`/proc/self/fd/<fd>`) must lie inside the
//     root's real path and pass the deny rules. That name is the file the handle holds, so no later
//     swap can change the answer.
//   - Elsewhere (no `/proc`): the path is resolved and checked again, and its `lstat` must be the
//     handle's own file (same device and inode). A swap still in place fails the containment; a swap
//     put back fails the identity.
// A hard link cannot be told apart by either check: it is the same inode under a name inside the
// root, so its real path and the kernel's name are both inside. It is served. Making one needs write
// access inside the root and (with Linux's `protected_hardlinks`) ownership of the target, which is
// the agent running as the operator's own user, and that agent can already read every file the
// bridge can. A file with more than one link is not refused either: package managers (pnpm) and
// tools hard-link ordinary files, and refusing them would refuse the files a root is made of.
//
// Pure where it can be (the path grammar, the order, the decoding); the disk half takes its file
// calls through {@link FilesFs}, so a test can stand one in.
