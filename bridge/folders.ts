// The folders a new space was created in on THIS machine, and the ones the operator starred (#289,
// M40/02). The new-space sheet reads them so a phone taps a folder instead of typing a path.
//
// ── ONE LIST PER MACHINE, KEPT BY THAT MACHINE'S OWN BRIDGE ─────────────────────
// A folder exists on one machine only, so the list lives where the folder does: `folders.json` in
// this instance's state dir, `snooze.json`'s and `notify-prefs.json`'s sibling. Every device the
// operator uses therefore sees one list per machine, and a crew reaches a peer's list through the
// lead exactly as it reaches that peer's launcher rows (CREW_PROTOCOL.md §5). It is NOT in the
// snapshot: the sheet reads it when it opens and when the chosen machine changes.
//
// ── THE FILE IS WRITTEN BY TWO EVENTS, AND BY NOTHING ELSE ──────────────────────
// A space created with a folder (the bridge records it itself, from the folder the multiplexer
// reported), and a star or an unstar from the phone. A bridge that is only started, only read, or
// only ever asked for spaces in home writes no `folders.json` at all, which is what keeps
// `bridge/solo-baseline.test.ts`'s written-entries assertion at four (CREW_PROTOCOL.md §11).
//
// ── STRINGS, NEVER PATHS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Nothing here opens, stats or resolves a stored folder. The multiplexer reported it, the file holds
// it, the phone gets it back, and the only operations on it are string equality and one trailing
// slash dropped. A folder that no longer exists stays until newer ones push it out; a create there
// fails with the multiplexer's own words and records nothing. So CLAUDE.md's rule about client
// values becoming paths gains no further place: a starred string must already be in Recent, and
// Recent only ever holds what a multiplexer said.
