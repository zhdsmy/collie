// The deposed state and the self-heal that ends it (RFC §8, CREW_PROTOCOL.md §18.11–§18.12).
//
// **A former lead that learns the crown has moved stops being a lead, loudly** — and then, in the
// ordinary case, finishes its own demotion all the way to `peer` on materials both machines already
// hold: no SSH, no token, no operator step and, decisively, **no new trust**.
//
// ── WHAT COUNTS AS LEARNING (RFC §8.1) ───────────────────────────────────────
// Exactly one thing: a warrant of a generation at least as high as its own, naming a deputy other
// than nobody, **verified against its own certificate's public key**. A lead can verify its own
// signature, and that is the whole reason the warrant is signed by the lead rather than attested by
// the deputy: what deposes a machine is its own past consent handed back to it. Nothing else does —
// not a peer refusing it, not an unreachable roster, not a timeout.
//
// ── WHY AN AUTOMATIC TRANSITION IS ALLOWED HERE AT ALL ───────────────────────
// Three properties, all of which must hold or this must not ship (RFC §12, F11):
//   1. It is strictly privilege-DECREASING — `lead` (§8.5's "everything, on every member") to
//      `peer` (its own terminals and nothing else). A machine demoting ITSELF to the least
//      privileged role in the protocol is not an escalation under any reading.
//   2. It is driven by a proof the machine itself signed.
//   3. It creates no trust that did not exist before: the new lead's certificate is read out of
//      **this machine's own roster** and never off the wire, so a fingerprint is only ever a pin if
//      the certificate behind it was already held.
// `deposed.test.ts` asserts (1) and (3) as a privilege-decrease check on the healed store.
//
// PURE, like `enrollment.ts` and `warrant.ts`: every function here is a function of data. Nothing
// reads a clock, a disk or a request — the caller supplies `now` and the caller writes the store.
