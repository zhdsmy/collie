/**
 * The trust store is read ONCE per process, at boot (`bridge/index.ts`), and everything shaped by it
 * — the mode, the roster the lead sweeps, the `ca` list a peer's listener pins — is built from that
 * one read. That is deliberate (§8.3: the crew secret never lives in a long-lived env; §3: a mode
 * discovered mid-startup has already opened what it meant to keep shut), and the membership verbs
 * restart the local service precisely because of it.
 *
 * It leaves one hole, which the two-instance harness walked straight into: **a membership change can
 * arrive at a RUNNING bridge over the wire**, from a machine whose operator is not this one.
 *
 *   - the first `join` lands in the lead's store through the lead's own `/crew/v1/enroll`. The lead
 *     persists the new peer and goes on merging nothing, because its `CrewLead` was built from a
 *     roster that was empty at boot;
 *   - `promote` demotes the old lead through `/crew/v1/lead`. It adopts the demotion on disk and
 *     keeps its lead-mode listener — unpinned — until something restarts it.
 *
 * Neither is fixed by re-reading the store in place: re-wiring a live process's mode, listener TLS
 * and sweep would be a second, concurrent startup path, and `server.reload({tls})` does not even swap
 * a pinned `ca` (M4/08's transport investigation). So the fix is the smallest honest one: **notice,
 * and say so.** This module is that noticing, and it is pure — the boot-time snapshot goes to disk as
 * a marker, the CLI compares the marker to the store, and `crew status` tells the operator to run the
 * restart that was always going to be required.

 * from the LATER of the receipt and that boot time. A checkpoint from a previous process is
 * therefore dominated by the new boot stamp and can never make a link look quieter than it is.

 * also see when NO process has refreshed it — which is what a stopped bridge looks like.
