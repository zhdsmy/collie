// Push convergence: ONE phone registration, on the lead (CREW_PROTOCOL.md §5, §10.1).
//
// ── THE SHAPE, AND WHY IT IS THIS ONE ────────────────────────────────────────
// Notifications for a peer's panes are derived ON THE LEAD, from the snapshots the lead already
// sweeps, through the SAME `NotificationCoordinator` a local session drives. Nothing new decides
// what is alert-worthy, what debouncing means, or how a herd collapses into one summary — a peer's
// alerts are the local machinery pointed at a body that arrived over HTTP.
//
// That follows from the protocol rather than from taste:
//   • §5 keeps `subscribe`, `snooze` and `notifications/prefs` OFF the crew surface — "push
//     subscriptions live on the lead; notification policy is one crew-wide setting the lead owns".
//     A peer therefore has nothing to fan a policy TO, and no phone to fan an alert to. The lead
//     being the only sender is what makes its snooze and its prefs crew-wide *by construction*
//     instead of by a fan-out that has to survive an unreachable peer.
//   • §10.1 makes the sweep part of the existing poll. This module arms no timer of its own; its
//     only entry point is {@link PeerNotifier.observe}, called from `CrewLead.sweep` with a body
//     that just landed.
//
// ── ONE COORDINATOR PER HOST, NOT ONE WIDER MAP ──────────────────────────────
// `NotificationCoordinator`'s `pending`/`outstanding` key on a bare pane id; which session (and now
// which host) an alert belongs to is implicit in WHICH INSTANCE holds it. So the host dimension is
// more instances, exactly as multi-session was — the maps inside the coordinator are untouched, and
// each host gets its own notification slot (`bridge/crew/tags.ts`) so a peer's pane can never
// overwrite a local pane's summary.
//
// ── AND WHAT A PEER DOES WITH ITS OWN PUSH ───────────────────────────────────
// See {@link herdPushGate}: in peer mode the herd path is MUTED, not deleted.

 * **Dedupe across sweeps falls out of this being a diff.** The lead sweeps every poll (~1.5 s) and a

 * that blocks once is announced once, no matter how many sweeps see it blocked afterwards.
 *
 * **Only fresh bodies reach here.** `CrewLead` calls the notifier only when a poll parsed a new

 * a peer going down never retracts its alerts and never re-raises them when it comes back.
