// PACK_PROTOCOL.md §18.14).
//
// ── WHY IT IS A SEPARATE FILE, AND WHY THAT IS NOT TIDINESS ──────────────────
// `PairingStore.enforced()` is **"the registry is non-empty"** (bridge/pairing.ts) — pairing is not a
// setting, it is the presence of a credential. So merging the lead's entries into the deputy's own
// `paired-devices.json` would silently switch on the deputy's OWN write gate, for its OWN operator, on
// a machine where nobody ever ran `collie pair`. A gate the operator did not arm is a lockout waiting
// for the day they use that machine directly. Hence: its own file, its own version, and one direction
// of travel — into the deputy's registry at takeover commit, never before, and never back.
//
// ── WHAT `bridge/server.ts` PROMISES, AND WHY THIS DOES NOT BREAK IT ─────────
// server.ts states that pairing is "NOT threaded into the crew surface … a lead does not hold one of
// this collie's pairing tokens and must never need one." That rule survives **verbatim**: no crew
// request is ever admitted by a pairing token, and `/pack/v1/pairing` is admitted by the crew's own
// two factors plus a role check like every other route. What is new is that a browser credential's
// HASH is carried ON a crew route and lands on a peer's disk — adjacent enough that the comment there
// gains this exception and a pointer (RFC §16, decision 5).
//
// ── ONLY HASHES CROSS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `{label, tokenHash, createdAt}` per device. The token was shown once, at claim time, and is not
// recoverable (`pairing.ts`), so a store that leaks yields nothing spendable — the same reasoning
// `PendingInvite` already runs on.
//
// PURE except for {@link StandbyDeviceStore}, which is the one thing here that touches a disk.
