// Crew admission: the two-factor gate every request on `/crew/v1/*` passes before any handler runs
// (CREW_PROTOCOL.md §8.1, ADR 0013). It is a PURE function of request-shaped facts and the trust
// store's contents — no Request, no socket, no clock — which is what makes the failure matrix in
// admission.test.ts a test of the shipping decision rather than of a harness.
//
// THIS IS NOT A WIDENING OF `checkAccess()`. It shares no code with it, and it must not grow any:
// `checkAccess` (bridge/server.ts:1113-1151) is a browser gate — an `Origin` compared against `Host`,
// an optional tailnet identity, an optional device header — and a crew request satisfies none of its
// preconditions by construction. The two consequences §6 spells out, restated as invariants of this
// module:
//   • browser credentials NEVER admit a crew request — nothing here reads Origin, Host or the device
//     header, so there is no path by which they could;
//   • the crew secret NEVER admits an `/api/*` request — this function is only ever called from the
//     crew prefix, and it returns a member id rather than an access level, so there is nothing for
//     an `/api/*` handler to consume even if someone wired it there by mistake.
