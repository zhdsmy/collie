// Signed membership requests (CREW_PROTOCOL.md §8.6).
//
// ── WHY THIS EXISTS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// §8.1's first factor is a pinned certificate, and on the PEER's listener that pin is enforced by
// BoringSSL at the handshake (`bridge/crew/transport.ts`). The LEAD cannot do the same: its crew
// surface rides the front door, and `tailscale serve` — or any conforming reverse proxy — terminates
// TLS before the process sees it, so no client certificate can survive to the lead under any design.
//
// A peer→lead request would therefore have exactly one factor (the crew secret), and the two requests
// that travel that direction are the two most consequential in the protocol: `leave` removes a member
// from a roster, and `lead` moves the crown (§14). A crew-wide bearer token is held by every member,
// so with the secret alone any member could speak for any other.
//
// So the second factor is re-established at the application layer, over the material both sides
// already pinned: the member signs a canonical statement of its own request with the private key
// behind its pinned certificate, and the receiver verifies it with the public key of the certificate
// it pinned. Nothing new is trusted, no new key material exists, and the guarantee is the same one
// the handshake gives on the other direction.
//
// PURE BY CONSTRUCTION. Everything below is a function of strings and bytes — no Request, no clock,
// no store — so `signing.test.ts` tests the shipping rule rather than a harness.

 *
 * Four fields and no more, each of which closes a specific substitution:
 *   • **method** — a signed `POST /crew/v1/leave` must not be replayable as anything else;
 *   • **path** — the same body must not be movable from `leave` to `lead`;
 *   • **body digest** — the claim inside the body (which member, which fingerprint) is what §14
 *     authenticates, so it has to be under the signature rather than beside it;
 *   • **timestamp** — carried in a header, but signed here, so an attacker cannot re-stamp a captured
 *     request to walk it forward through the skew window.
 *
 * The **query string is deliberately absent**: no membership route takes one, and signing a value no
 * route reads would be a rule that silently stops holding the day one does. A membership route that
 * ever grows a parameter must extend this string and the version that goes with it.
 *
 * **Neither the RECEIVER nor the crew id is named here**, so a signed request verifies at *any* collie
 * that pins the signer's certificate — not only at the one it was aimed at. This is inert today because
 * roster topology bounds who-pins-whom: a peer pins only its lead and a lead pins only its members
 * (§8.2), so a given signer's key is pinned in exactly one place and a captured signature has exactly
 * one collie it could replay at. A v2 that broadens that — a peer pinning more than one lead, a shared
 * or nested roster (ADR 0012's "what would justify revisiting") — MUST bind a receiver identity and/or
 * the crew id into this string, or a signature minted for one collie would verify at another that
 * happens to pin the same key.
 *
 * `path` is the URL's pathname only — never the host. A crew member is dialled at an address the
 * operator owns and may re-point (§4, `collie reconnect`); binding the signature to it would make
 * roaming a signature failure.

// ── The dial attestation (§8.6, added 2026-08-20) ────────────────────────────
//
// **What it is for, stated first, because it is NOT the request signature above.** A peer whose
// listener carries a second TLS anchor (§8.1's 2026-08-20 amendment) can no longer read "the
// handshake was pin-enforcing" as "the caller is my lead" — the list names one of two, and Bun
// exposes no accessor for which certificate was presented. So the caller SAYS which, with its key:
// every lead→peer dial carries a signature, and a two-anchored peer resolves identity from **which
// pinned certificate verifies it**, never from the transport boolean.
//
// ── WHY IT IS A SECOND OBJECT AND NOT `canonicalRequest` ─────────────────────
// Two facts about this surface make the four-field request string unusable here, and both are
// load-bearing rather than inconvenient:
//
//   1. **The body cannot be hashed.** A proxied write streams `req.body` straight through (§13, up to
//      10 MB of multipart, never buffered on the lead — `bridge/crew/forward.ts`). Signing a digest
//      would mean buffering every upload in the lead's memory *on the security path*, which is the
//      exact trade §8.6's SIGNABLE_PATHS was drawn to avoid.
//   2. **`canonicalRequest` names no RECEIVER**, and its own doc says a v2 that broadens who-pins-whom
//      "MUST bind a receiver identity … or a signature minted for one collie would verify at another
//      that happens to pin the same key". This IS that broadening: a two-anchored peer pins two
//      members, and the lead dials the deputy exactly as it dials every other member — so the deputy
//      legitimately holds lead-signed dials and could otherwise present them at a sibling peer.
//
// So this string **binds the receiver and omits the body**, and is kept structurally disjoint from
// both the request string and the warrant by a fixed domain tag (the warrant's rule, RFC §4.3).
//
// ── WHAT IT DOES NOT CLAIM ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
// **Identity, not integrity.** Body integrity on this hop is TLS's, and TLS is not weakened by any of
// this: the connection is pinned mutual TLS to one of two certificates the operator chose. The
// attacker this closes is a compromised DEPUTY being read as the lead, and a compromised deputy
// cannot produce the lead's signature over any string at all.
//
// **Freshness is the skew window, not the replay floor.** `TrustedMember.signedAt` is advanced only by
// signed MEMBERSHIP calls (§8.6), and it must stay that way: the lead makes several dials
// concurrently within one millisecond, so a monotonic floor here would refuse all but one of every
// sweep. What bounds a captured dial instead is the receiver binding — the only party positioned to
// capture one is the receiver itself, and it is the only collie it verifies at.
