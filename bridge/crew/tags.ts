// ── WHY A SEPARATE FILE, AND WHY IT ONLY EVER *ADDS* ─────────────────────────
// `herdTagFor()` is a live contract with notifications currently sitting on somebody's lock screen:
// the primary keeps the bare `collie:herd` deliberately, "so notifications outstanding from before
// this feature don't orphan" (`bridge/sessions.ts`). The crew owes that same discipline one level
// up — a solo user who upgrades and never joins a crew must see literally no change — so this module
// DELEGATES to `herdTagFor()` for anything on this machine and only mints a new shape for a peer.
// `bridge/solo-baseline.test.ts` pins the local strings; `tags.test.ts` pins that this file is a
// pass-through for them.

/**
 * Separates the base tag from the host that owns the slot. `@` and not `:` on purpose — see
 * {@link crewHerdTagFor} for the injectivity argument, which is the whole reason this constant is
 * not a free choice.

/**
 * The herd notification slot for one `(host, session)` pair.
 *
 * - `host === undefined` — this collie's own session. Byte-for-byte `herdTagFor()`, forever: the
 *   lead's own tags must not move when it grows a crew, or every alert outstanding on the operator's
 *   phone at `collie join` time orphans into a slot nothing will ever clear.
 * - a peer — `collie:herd@<host>` for that peer's primary session, `collie:herd@<host>:<name>` for
 *   any other, mirroring the local `:`-suffix rule one level out.
 *
 * **Why the two families can never collide.** A member id is `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,62}`
 * (`bridge/crew/identity.ts`), so it contains neither `@` nor `:`. The character immediately after
 * `collie:herd` is therefore the discriminator: `@` ⇒ a peer's slot, `:` ⇒ a local named session,
 * nothing ⇒ the local primary. A session name is a directory name and may contain anything, but it
 * only ever appears AFTER that discriminator — so a local session cleverly named `@laptop` yields
 * `collie:herd:@laptop`, which is not `collie:herd@laptop`. Pure + exported so this argument is a
 * test rather than a comment.
