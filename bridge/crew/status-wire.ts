// The body of `GET /api/crew` (bridge/types.ts, {@link CrewStatusResponse}) — the browser's read-only
// view of what `collie crew status` prints, composed from what the RUNNING lead already holds.
//
// ── WHY THIS FILE IS PURE, AND WHY THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT ───────────────────
// It takes a trust store snapshot, the lead's own identity, its per-peer beliefs and a clock
// reading, and returns a body. No fetch, no timer, no disk, no registry — which is not a testing
// convenience here but the route's actual guarantee: a surface the phone polls must not be able to
// make the lead dial a member. The sweep is the ONLY thing that talks to peers (CREW_PROTOCOL.md
// §10.1, §11 — "no second timer"), and a function with no transport in its signature cannot become
// a second one no matter what a later caller does.
//
// ── IT REPORTS; IT NEVER DECIDES ─────────────────────────────────────────────
// Every value below is copied from somewhere that already owns it. Health, reason, freshness,
// version and the conflict come from {@link PeerState}, which is the single owner of "what the lead
// believes about member X" (registry.ts). Mode comes from `deriveMode`, the same function the whole
// process hangs off (mode.ts). The deputy comes from the DESIGNATION, for the reason
// `cli/crew-status-deputy.ts` states at length. Nothing here re-derives a verdict, so this page and
// `crew status` cannot disagree about the same machine.
//
// ── AND WHAT IT MAY NOT CARRY ────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The store handed in holds the crew secret, every member's certificate and every fingerprint. None
// of them is a field of {@link CrewStatusResponse} and none may become one — the same discipline
// `toPaneWire` applies to a pane and `merge.ts` applies to a peer's snapshot.
