// The PEER's own authorisation for a request that arrived over a crew link (CREW_PROTOCOL.md §12).
//
// ── THE RULE THIS FILE EXISTS FOR ────────────────────────────────────────────
// "A peer is never asked to trust the lead's authorisation decision in place of its own. The peer
// applies its own write-level checks to a crew request; the lead's gate does not stand in for them."
//
// So: the lead having decided the operator may write is NOT an input here. Nothing in this module
// reads a verdict from the wire. What it reads is the peer's OWN config — the same `deviceHeader` +
// `deviceAllowlist` its own operator set — applied to the device identity the link carried.
//
// ── WHY NOT JUST CALL guard() ────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `guard()`/`checkAccess()` are a BROWSER gate: an `Origin` compared against a `Host`, a host
// allowlist against DNS rebinding, an `Origin`-required-for-writes rule against CSRF. A crew request
// satisfies none of those preconditions by construction — it is not a browser, has no origin, and is
// not subject to CSRF because no browser can be made to emit it. Running it through `checkAccess`
// would refuse every forwarded write on a rule about a threat that is not present.
//
// What that rule was BUYING — proof the request came from someone entitled to drive this terminal —
// is bought here by the crew link's two independent factors (pinned certificate + crew secret, §8.1,
// ADR 0013), which are strictly stronger than same-origin. The device layer is what remains, and it
// is what this function applies, unchanged and locally owned.

 * evaluated against the device the lead forwarded as `X-Crew-Device`:
 *
 *   - device feature off on this peer  → authorised (today's behaviour for its own operator, and it
 *     would be strange for enrolling in a crew to silently turn on a gate nobody configured);
 *   - device absent                    → read-only. The lead omits the header when ITS gate is off,
 *     and a peer that turned the gate on asked for every write to name a device;
 *   - device present and allowlisted   → authorised, and the peer's audit line names it;
 *   - device present, not on THIS      → read-only. This is the case the whole file is about: the
 *     peer's allowlist, not the lead's, decides. A device the lead trusts and the peer does not
 *     cannot write on the peer.
 *
 * Reads are always allowed: the link's two factors already admitted the caller, and mirroring a pane
 * is exactly what a crew is for. That is the same asymmetry `guard()` has locally.
