//
// One number, stamped on this collie's own clock, refreshed by every admitted crew request from the
// member it pins as its lead — a poll, a proxied pane read, a forwarded write alike. That mirrors
// §10.2's "every landed call is a receipt" rule (`registry.ts` → `recordExchange`) and it exists for
// the same reason: the sweep relaxes to `COLLIE_POLL_IDLE_MS` while a phone watching a pane polls at
// 1.5 s, so a receipt that only the sweep refreshed would describe a perfectly healthy link as quiet.
//
// ── IN MEMORY, NEVER PERSISTED ───────────────────────────────────────────────
// This describes a PROCESS, and §7.1's rule for exactly this shape applies: a persisted receipt
// would survive the restart it is meant to report and would then state a falsehood with the
// authority of the trust store. {@link LeadContact.processStartedAt} covers the boot case instead —
// a collie that has just started has never been dialled by anyone, and the arming rule that reads
// this (RFC §6.3) takes the LATER of the two so a reboot cannot read as silence.
//
// It has exactly one home. A door that arms on a fact `crew status` does not print is a door nobody
// can explain, so the deputy's arming signal and the peer's status line read this same number.
