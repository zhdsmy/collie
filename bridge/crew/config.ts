// new configuration surface; `bridge/solo-baseline.test.ts` enforces exactly that by pinning

// key every solo deployment carries, reads and can typo — so crew settings live behind the mode,
// parsed in the same env-pure style (the reader itself is imported from config.ts, not re-written).
//
// Solo resolves this whole module from `null` + an env with none of these keys set, and gets a
// value that changes nothing.
