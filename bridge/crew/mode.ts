// The mode seam. CREW_PROTOCOL.md §3: "A collie runs in exactly one mode, decided by its enrollment
// state, not by a flag the operator maintains by hand." Everything federation-shaped hangs off the
// value this file computes, so "does a solo user pay for this?" is answerable by reading one file
// instead of auditing a feature.
//
// This module is PURE. It reads no filesystem, no environment and no clock — the trust store
// (M4/02) is the sole source of enrollment, and it is handed in. That is not stylistic: it is what
// makes the zero-tax gate checkable, because a solo instance's mode is computed from `null` and
// therefore cannot touch a byte of disk (CREW_PROTOCOL.md §11, "Files written": no key, no
// certificate, no trust store, no roster).

 * **v1 answers the "can one collie be lead of one crew and peer of another?" question with no.**
 * A crew is a star with one lead (§1), and the two roles disagree about the front door: a lead keeps
 * `tailscale serve`, a peer publishes nothing. There is no coherent front-door answer for an
 * instance holding both, so the ambiguous input resolves toward **peer** — the mode that publishes
 * less. Failing closed here means a corrupted or hand-edited roster can never *open* a front door;
 * the worst it can do is withhold one, which the conflict line explains.
 *
 * **A peer never self-demotes.** This function takes no clock and no reachability signal on purpose:
 * a peer whose lead has been gone for a month is still a peer. The alternative — demoting to solo
 * after some timeout — would have an unattended machine re-publish a front door nobody asked for,
 * which is exactly the surface ADR 0001 exists to keep singular. Leaving the crew is an operator
 * action (`collie leave`), i.e. it empties the trust store; it is not a timeout.
