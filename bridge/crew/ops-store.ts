// The ops store: how the operator reached a member ONCE, so they need not retype it.
//
// ── THIS IS NOT TRUST, AND IT IS NOT A WIRE FIELD (ADR 0016) ─────────────────
// Every value here is something the operator typed on their own command line — an ssh host, a remote
// checkout path, a port. It is convenience, kept beside the trust store rather than inside it: the
// trust store's fields are whitelisted by `TRUST_STORE_VERSION` and every one of them is material a
// pin or a secret depends on, so an ssh hostname in there would be a routing hint with a trust file's
// authority. Nothing in this file ever crosses the crew link, in either direction — a peer neither
// sends nor learns how its operator dials it (CREW_PROTOCOL.md §11's spirit, ADR 0016's rule).
//
// It is written by `crew add` (on a run that finished) and refreshed by `crew update` when the
// operator overrides one of its fields. A member with no record here is not broken — it is a member
// this machine has never SSH'd to, and `crew update` says exactly that.
//
// **Nothing deletes a row.** `crew remove` used to, and that was the bug (F16): removal is the exact
// moment the operator needs the ssh destination, because the far machine keeps its copy of the crew
// until `collie leave` runs THERE, and the row is the connection that reaches it. So `crew remove`
// prints the line and keeps the row. A stale row costs nothing — `crew update` builds its targets
// from the roster and only then looks a member up here, so a row for a machine that is not a member
// can never be dialled — and a re-add overwrites it. Forgetting one is `rm` on this file.
//
// At rest it reuses the trust store's discipline verbatim ({@link fsTrustStoreIo}): 0600 in a 0700
// directory, temp-file-then-rename. It holds no secret, but it names hosts an operator can reach, and
// there is no reason for that to be more readable than the roster it sits next to.
