# Install in five minutes

This guide sets up Collie on your phone. Install three tools on your computer, start Collie,
and pair your phone.

It uses the recommended setup: Tailscale as the front door, Herdr as the multiplexer, and the
install script. For other setups, see [Install](install.md).

> **Note.** Collie gives remote shell access to your machine by design. Read
> [Security](security.md) before you install it.

## What you need

- A Linux or macOS computer (the host). A Mac needs Apple Silicon
  and macOS 13 or newer.
- An iPhone or an Android phone.
- A Tailscale account.

## 1. Install Tailscale

Tailscale links the host and your phone on one private network, your tailnet. Collie is reachable
only on that network.

On a Linux host:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
sudo tailscale up --operator=$USER
```

`--operator=$USER` lets your user run `tailscale serve`, which Collie needs in step 4.

On a Mac, install Tailscale from [tailscale.com/download](https://tailscale.com/download)
and sign in. Install the `tailscale` command from the app settings. Collie calls it.

Next, set up the tailnet and the phone:

1. Open the [admin console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/dns) and select **Enable HTTPS**.
   Collie requires it.
2. Install the Tailscale app on your phone. Sign in with the same account.

## 2. Install Herdr

Herdr keeps terminal panes and coding agents running on the host when you disconnect.
Collie shows those panes on your phone.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://herdr.dev/install.sh | sh    # or: brew install herdr
herdr
```

Herdr opens a pane. Start your agent there, for example `claude`. Leave Herdr running.

## 3. Install Collie

Open a second terminal on the host and run the install script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://colliepwa.dev/install.sh | sh
```

The script saves the `collie` binary to `~/.local/bin`. It does not use `sudo`. If your shell
cannot find `collie`, add `~/.local/bin` to your PATH. [Standalone](install.md#standalone)
covers the details.

## 4. Start Collie

```bash
COLLIE_MUX=herdr collie start
```

`start` runs Collie in the background and exposes it on your tailnet with
`tailscale serve`. It saves `herdr` as the multiplexer. Future runs need only `collie start`. When
ready, it prints **Collie is running** and shows your URL on the `tailnet` line, for example
`https://myhost.tail1234.ts.net`.

On a remote Linux host reached by SSH, keep Collie running after logout:

```bash
loginctl enable-linger $USER
```

## 5. Put Collie on your phone and pair it

```bash
collie qr
```

1. Scan the QR code with your phone camera to open Collie in the browser.
2. Add Collie to your home screen so it opens full screen like an app.
   - **iPhone:** in Safari, tap **Share**, tap **Add to Home Screen**, and tap **Add**.
   - **Android:** in Chrome, open Collie **Settings** and tap **Install** on the top card.
3. Open Collie from the new icon.
4. Run `collie pair` on the host to print an 8-character code, valid for 10 minutes.
5. In Collie, open **Settings → System → Paired devices**.
6. Enter the code and a name, for example `my phone`, and tap **Pair this device**.

Pair inside the home screen app, not in the browser tab. On an iPhone, the home screen app keeps
its own storage, separate from Safari. A pairing made in Safari does not carry over.

Collie answers no device until it is paired: before step 6, the dashboard shows **Pair this
device** and no panes. Only paired devices can read or type into your panes. On a tailnet shared
with other people, also set `COLLIE_TRUSTED_USER` ([Configure](configure.md#configure)).

The dashboard lists your Herdr panes. Panes waiting for input appear first. Tap a pane to
view output and reply.
