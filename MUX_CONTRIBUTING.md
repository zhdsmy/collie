# Adding a mux adapter

Collie drives a **multiplexer** — the thing that owns the panes. Herdr is the reference adapter;
tmux and zellij are the ones this seam was built for. This is how you add another.

A *harness* (claude, codex, pi, omp) is what runs **inside** a pane and has its own seam —
[`HARNESS_CONTRIBUTING.md`](./HARNESS_CONTRIBUTING.md). Don't cross them: a capability question is
never answered by a harness lookup, and a harness question is never answered by the mux name.

Read first: [`MUX_CONTRACT.md`](./MUX_CONTRACT.md) (the capability matrix — every cell cites the
probe that proved it), the port itself [`bridge/mux/types.ts`](./bridge/mux/types.ts), and
[ADR 0022](./.adr/0022-the-mux-seam-is-a-port-collie-owns.md) for why "just point the Herdr client at
it" is not an adapter.

## Architecture in one paragraph

An adapter is a [`MuxAdapter`](./bridge/mux/types.ts), registered by its own name in
[`bridge/mux/registry.ts`](./bridge/mux/registry.ts). Three of its methods are the **floor** —
`reachable()`, `snapshot()` and `refresh()`; an adapter that cannot answer the first two has nothing
for Collie to render, and the third ("look now") asks for nothing you do not already do on your own
schedule. Everything else is a **declared capability**
([`capabilities.ts`](./bridge/mux/capabilities.ts)): the adapter says yes or no, and a route asks the
capability, never the name. Beside the capabilities sit the declared **facts** — `topologyLatency`
(how soon you see a change nobody announced) is one, and it is required, because an unstated bound is
one the operator gets told about by being surprised
([ADR 0031](./.adr/0031-freshness-is-a-declared-promise.md)). Three things the contract
owns outright and you do not get to redecide: the **refusal shape**
([`types.ts`](./bridge/mux/types.ts) — four reasons, and `unsupported` is not a failure), **identity**
([`identity.ts`](./bridge/mux/identity.ts) — five rules), and the **neutral key spelling**
([`keys.ts`](./bridge/mux/keys.ts) — `ctrl+c`, not `C-c` and not `"Ctrl c"`). Herdr's adapter
([`bridge/mux/herdr/`](./bridge/mux/herdr/)) is four files and is the shape to copy: `client.ts` is
the transport and the only file that knows the multiplexer's own wire, `adapter.ts` is the whole
translation, `keys.ts` and `events.ts` are the two tables.

If your multiplexer has no socket and its client is a **binary**, copy
[`bridge/mux/tmux/`](./bridge/mux/tmux/) instead — same split, one file more: `exec.ts` is the
subprocess seam (and the only place that spawns), `protocol.ts` is the argv it builds and the text it
parses, `watch.ts` owns the long-lived child, and `adapter.ts` is still the whole translation. The
seam being an interface is what lets the fixture drive it with a scripted exec.
[`bridge/mux/zellij/`](./bridge/mux/zellij/) is the same split plus `session.ts`, because that
multiplexer's every verb is scoped to one session and resolving which one is a decision two modules
need — and it is the worked example of a **hybrid** watch: a real stream for content, a bounded
census for the topology events its CLI does not have.

## Probe first, declare second

**An unprobed cell is never declared supported.** Every `true` in your declaration must trace to a
verb you have run against a real multiplexer and watched work — that is what
[`MUX_CONTRACT.md`](./MUX_CONTRACT.md) is: the evidence, per cell, with the probe that produced it.
A capability declared aspirationally is worse than one declared absent, because absent degrades
visibly (M10/06) and a wrong `true` fails in the operator's hands.

Declare less than you can build. An adapter that reads and types is a real adapter; the contract is
what makes the rest addable later without a rewrite.

**Two answers are not capabilities and you owe both anyway.** `MuxPane.focused` — the pane the
operator's own terminal is showing — is on the floor, because every multiplexer knows it; only
CHANGING it is a capability (`setFocus`), and a multiplexer that can bring a pane's container forward
but cannot say which pane inside it ends up focused declares that ABSENT rather than half-keeping the
promise (zellij is exactly that case). And `spaces: "one" | "many"` says how many spaces your
multiplexer can hold — not how many exist today — so the UI can drop a level it does not have.
Omitting it declares `"many"`, which is the harmless direction.

## What conformance demands

[`bridge/mux/conformance.ts`](./bridge/mux/conformance.ts) is the gate, and it answers four questions.
Each has burned this codebase before on some other axis:

1. **Is the declaration honest — in both directions?** Every capability you declare is exercised and
   must work. Every one you *don't* is **called**, and must answer the contract's `unsupported`
   naming itself — never throw, never succeed, never return an empty value that reads as success.
2. **Is identity stable?** A pane keeps its Collie id across a reconnect, an out-of-band rename and a
   restart of the multiplexer; two panes never collide; a dead pane's id is never reused
   ([`identity.ts`](./bridge/mux/identity.ts) rules 2–4). An id derived from a label, a title or a
   position fails here — and nothing above the adapter can repair a moving id.
3. **Are the semantics the contract's?** `styling:"strip"` really strips; a read echoes the pane it
   was asked for; `revision` moves when the pane's content does; a two-key batch arrives as two keys
   in order; a call aimed at a pane that has gone away answers **`gone`**, not `unreachable`.
4. **Does it degrade rather than lie?** A constant `revision` silently disables the race guard. A key
   listed in `unsupportedKeys` that gets sent anyway is worse than no list. `agentDetection`
   declared over a world of bare shells proves nothing.

Nothing in that file imports a test framework: a check returns its problems as strings, which is what
lets the same checks run in both layers below.

## Your deliverable: a fixture

You write **no test file**. The suite ([`conformance.test.ts`](./bridge/mux/conformance.test.ts))
iterates `MUX_ADAPTERS` and pairs each entry with its fixture, and it **fails an adapter that has
none**. So adding a multiplexer is exactly two lines plus your module:

1. your factory in [`bridge/mux/registry.ts`](./bridge/mux/registry.ts) → `MUX_ADAPTERS`
2. your fixture in [`bridge/mux/fixtures.ts`](./bridge/mux/fixtures.ts) → `MUX_CONFORMANCE_FIXTURES`

A fixture is a `MuxConformanceFixture`: `create()` hands back a **world** — your adapter built over an
*injected* transport, plus the perturbations no adapter can simulate from outside itself:

| World member | What it must do |
| --- | --- |
| `adapter` | your real adapter, over a fake transport — not a stub of the adapter |
| `writes()` | every write the transport saw, in order (literal text for `text`, one entry per key for `keys`) |
| `reconnect()` | the adapter's connection drops and comes back; the herd is untouched |
| `restartMux()` | the multiplexer **process** restarts with the same session — rebuild your records as fresh objects |
| `renameOutOfBand()` | someone renames a pane in the multiplexer's own UI, not through Collie |
| `changePane()` | the pane paints something new |
| `endPane()` | the pane's process ends and the multiplexer forgets it |
| `pokeTopologyOutOfBand()` | the herd's shape changes and **nothing announces it** — rename a tab in your fake world, emit no event. This is what proves `refresh()` |
| `pokeTopology()` / `pokePane()` | announce a change on the event channel — **required if** you declare `pushTopologyEvents` / `pushPaneEvents` |
| `close()` | tear it down; idempotent |

A world is single-use (half the checks end by destroying something) and must start **non-trivial**:
at least three live panes across two tabs, with a real agent pane when you declare `agentDetection`,
and a session ref when you declare `agentSessionRef`. A world of one bare shell lets half the suite
pass vacuously.

Two **spaces** as well, wherever your multiplexer has two — Herdr and tmux do. Where it genuinely
cannot (zellij's every verb is scoped to one session, so one adapter instance is one space), seed one
and say why in the fixture's header. The rule is "as many spaces as the multiplexer can actually
have", never a faked level.

Herdr's is [`bridge/mux/herdr/fixture.ts`](./bridge/mux/herdr/fixture.ts) — an in-memory `HerdrRpc`
that answers exactly what the documented server answers, including its `pane_not_found` codes and its
always-false `truncated`. **A fake that is kinder than the real server proves nothing.** (The other
in-repo fake, [`bridge/crew/fake-herdr.ts`](./bridge/crew/fake-herdr.ts), is a real unix-socket
daemon; it exists because *its* subject is the pack transport. Conformance's subject is the adapter,
so its fake is state transitions rather than bytes — deterministic, and runnable anywhere.)

Keep your adapter injectable enough for this to be possible: depend on a **narrow structural type**
for your transport, not on a concrete class (`HerdrRpc` in
[`bridge/mux/herdr/client.ts`](./bridge/mux/herdr/client.ts) is a `Pick` of the real client, so it
cannot drift from it). Anything needing `Bun.serve`/`Bun.connect` is unit-untestable — see
[`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) § Tests.

## The two layers

- **Pure — the CI gate.** `bun test bridge/mux`. Runs with **no multiplexer installed**, against every
  registered adapter, through your fixture's fake transport. This is what has to be green.
- **Live — opt-in, and read-only by design.** `bun scripts/mux-probe.ts` runs only the checks that
  write nothing, against whatever is actually running on the box:

  ```sh
  bun scripts/mux-probe.ts                                     # every registered adapter
  COLLIE_MUX_ENDPOINT_TMUX=/tmp/tmux-1000/default \
    bun scripts/mux-probe.ts --mux tmux                        # tell it where yours listens
  ```

  It **skips loudly** when your multiplexer is absent — a skip prints why and is never counted as a
  pass. It never types into, renames or closes a live pane, and that is not a limitation to lift: a
  live pane is somebody's work session. What it adds is what a fake cannot — real escape sequences,
  real id shapes, real timing.

Run both. Then `bun run test` (the whole backend suite) and `SKIP_TESTS=1 bun run build` (lint +
both typechecks).

## Things that will bite you

- **The grid is already rendered.** Collie runs no terminal emulator and never will
  ([ADR 0008](./.adr/0008-collie-does-not-run-a-terminal-emulator.md)). If your multiplexer won't hand
  over a rendered screen carrying colour and nothing else, **decline `paneGrid`** — you don't get a VT
  parser written for you.
- **Host-local, always.** Nothing in the port takes a host and nothing may grow one. A remote machine
  is reached by talking to the Collie running on it, never by dialling its multiplexer across a
  machine boundary ([ADR 0011](./.adr/0011-the-pack-protocol-is-the-mux-driver-seam.md)).
- **A missing key is not a missing door.** One key your multiplexer can't send goes in
  `unsupportedKeys` (canonically spelled, or the suite rejects it) and is answered `refused`.
  `sendKeys` stays declared.
- **Scrollback is not history.** `gridScrollback` is untyped screen text. `agentSessionRef` is the
  agent's own log, which the journal axis reads and which knows turns and tools
  ([`bridge/journal/`](./bridge/journal/)). Never answer one with the other.
- **A batch is a sequence.** If one key in a batch can't be sent, send **none** of it — half a chord
  delivered leaves the pane somewhere the caller cannot reason about.
- **Herdr is the reference, not the specification.** Where the contract and a multiplexer disagree,
  that is a finding about the contract. Take it to the port, not to a special case in your adapter.
