# CLAUDE.md — working agreement for this repo

**Collie** (repo `AltanS/collie`) — a phone web UI for your Herdr agent herd, served over
Tailscale. A mobile-first PWA (Vite + React + TS + Tailwind v4 + shadcn) plus a Bun/TS bridge that
talks to Herdr's Unix socket, letting you monitor and reply to agents from a phone. The Herdr
plugin id is `herdr.collie` (manifest: `herdr-plugin.toml`). Orientation:
[`README.md`](./README.md) · [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) · verified API
[`HERDR_API.md`](./HERDR_API.md) · decisions [`.adr/`](./.adr/) · adding a harness
[`HARNESS_CONTRIBUTING.md`](./HARNESS_CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Decision records — read before reopening a settled question

[`.adr/`](./.adr/) holds the decisions whose reasoning would otherwise live only in a PR thread —
specifically the ones that **close off an option someone will reasonably propose again**. If you're
about to argue *why not* rather than *how*, check there first; if the answer isn't there and the
decision is that shape, add one (numbering + format: [`.adr/README.md`](./.adr/README.md)).

Rules elsewhere in this file stay short and normative and link to the ADR for the argument. Don't
restate an ADR's reasoning here, and don't edit a superseded ADR into agreement with the present —
mark it superseded and write the next one.

## Versioning — MANDATORY

This plugin is **SemVer**ed, and the version is **enforced**, so it never silently drifts.

**The version lives in three files that must always agree, plus a matching CHANGELOG entry:**
`herdr-plugin.toml` (canonical — Herdr reads it) · `package.json` · `web/package.json` ·
newest `## [x.y.z]` heading in `CHANGELOG.md`.

**Before committing any functional change** (anything under `bridge/`, `web/src/`, `scripts/`, or the
manifest) you MUST:

1. **Bump** the version in all three files to the same number. The axis is **what the operator has
   to do**, not how visible the change is:
   - **PATCH** (`0.2.0 → 0.2.1`): the code now does what it was always meant to do — bug fixes and
     internal refactors. A fix may well change what you see; that alone never promotes it. When the
     correction is big enough that someone should read the notes, say so loudly in the CHANGELOG
     entry rather than inflating the bump.
   - **MINOR** (`0.2.0 → 0.3.0`): something is there that wasn't — a new capability, setting,
     surface, or action. Existing setups keep working untouched.
   - **MAJOR** (`0.2.0 → 1.0.0`): the operator must change something — a config key renamed or
     removed, a contract broken, a workflow that used to work and now doesn't.
2. **Add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry** under a new `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD` heading (Added / Changed /
   Fixed). Use the real date. **Style: super crisp and short** — one line per change, no prose
   paragraphs, and cite the feature's short commit hash at the end of the line (`… (abc1234)`).
   Land features as their own commits first, then cut the release commit so the entry can cite them.
3. **Run `scripts/check-version.sh`** — it must print `✓`.

**A PR from a fork is the exception: leave all four files alone.** Bump nothing, add no CHANGELOG
entry — send the functional commits only. The version is the maintainer's to pick, because it depends
on what else lands in the same release and on which axis the *sum* of those changes sits; a bump
guessed at PR time collides with the `chore(release):` commit that actually cuts the release, and two
PRs both guessing `0.26.1` conflict with each other. `scripts/check-version.sh` stays green either
way — all four files simply keep the version they already agree on. The pre-commit hook may object
locally; `SKIP_VERSION_CHECK=1 git commit …` is the intended escape hatch here. If you'd like a
CHANGELOG line in your words, put it in the PR description and it'll be used. (Maintainer side: when
a fork PR does carry a release commit, cherry-pick the functional commits with `-x` and drop that one
— authorship is preserved and `main` stays unreleased until you cut it.)

Doc-only changes (`*.md`) don't need a bump. This is enforced two ways, but **you are the first
line — do it as part of the change, not after**:

- `scripts/check-version.sh` runs inside `scripts/collie-ctl.sh build` (a release can't build while
  versions disagree).
- A **git pre-commit hook** (`scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit`, activate once with
  `scripts/install-hooks.sh`) blocks commits where functional code changed but the version didn't.
  Escape hatch for a single commit: `SKIP_VERSION_CHECK=1 git commit …`.

**Tag the release when you push it.** Cutting a release means the three version files + the newest
`CHANGELOG.md` heading agree on `x.y.z` (steps 1–3). When that release lands on `main` and you push,
**always push a matching annotated git tag with it** — `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Collie X.Y.Z" && git
push origin vX.Y.Z` (or `git push --follow-tags` so the tag ships *with* the release). One `v<x.y.z>`
tag per shipped version on the remote. Not hook-enforced — it's on you. (Adding/adjusting this note is
a doc-only change and needs no version bump.)

**Update notice (user-facing).** The app's in-app update banner links to the newest release's GitHub
page and shows the command to run. Pushing a `v*` tag auto-creates that GitHub Release (with the
commands) via `.github/workflows/release.yml`. **Always express user-facing update/restart
instructions as Herdr plugin actions** — `herdr plugin action invoke update --plugin herdr.collie`
(or `restart`) — never `collie-ctl.sh …` / `systemctl … collie`, which depend on the caller's cwd and
the unit name; the Herdr action runs from anywhere.

## Build / run (operational facts that are easy to forget)

- **There are two checkout shapes, and `update` handles both.** `herdr plugin install` does not clone
  — it leaves a **detached, shallow** checkout, so `git pull` cannot run there; a linked clone sits on
  a branch. One predicate (`git symbolic-ref -q HEAD`) picks the strategy, and the same predicate
  stops `update` re-linking a managed checkout — a re-link re-registers the plugin as local and Herdr
  then refuses `herdr plugin install`, the operator's only other way to refresh
  ([ADR 0006](./.adr/0006-update-advances-the-checkout-herdr-installed.md)).
- **Frontend changes** (`web/`): rebuild with `bun run build` (root) or `cd web && bun run build`.
  The bridge serves `web/dist` **from disk at request time**, so on the deployment host
  a rebuild is **immediately live — no restart**.
- **Backend changes** (`bridge/*.ts`): Bun does **not** hot-reload the service — you must
  `systemctl --user restart collie`. Forgetting this is the #1 "my change didn't take" trap.
- `bun run build` (root) and `collie-ctl.sh build` **typecheck both sides first** (root tsc + web
  tsc), then build web to `dist-staging` and swap it in atomically — a failed build never empties a
  live `web/dist`. Bare `cd web && bun run build` still skips typechecking; don't ship from it.
- **Tests:** frontend `cd web && bun run test` (Vitest + jsdom + Testing Library + MSW; no headless
  browser); backend `bun run test` at the root — Bun's own runner over every pure-logic module in
  `bridge/` (access checks, state engine, config, journal adapters, notifications, uploads, …) plus
  `scripts/collie-ctl.test.sh`, which exercises the ctl lifecycle in a sandboxed HOME.
  A **pre-push hook** (`scripts/git-hooks/pre-push`) runs **both** before
  every push — override once with `SKIP_TESTS=1 git push`. The bits that genuinely need `Bun.serve` /
  `Bun.connect` (HTTP handlers, the socket client) stay unit-untested — Vitest-on-Node can't run them,
  so keep new backend logic pure/injectable enough for `bun test`, or exercise it through `web/`.
- Service: `systemd --user` unit `collie` on the deployment host; logs `journalctl --user -u collie -f`.
- **Dependencies must be 7 days old to install** (`bunfig.toml` + `web/bunfig.toml`, mirrored in
  `.npmrc` for npm users) — a compromised release is usually pulled within hours. A brand-new
  version resolving to an older one is the rule working, not a bug; CI's `--frozen-lockfile` is
  unaffected.
- TS is strict on both sides, with `noUnusedLocals/Parameters` everywhere. **`web/` additionally**
  enforces `verbatimModuleSyntax` + `erasableSyntaxOnly` (use `import type`, no parameter-property
  shorthand there). The **bridge** tsconfig does not enable those two — bridge code uses
  parameter-property shorthand by convention; keep each side consistent with itself.

## Frontend data layer (React Router, not TanStack)

- Data flows through **React Router** (`createBrowserRouter`, data mode): route **loaders**
  (`web/src/lib/loaders.ts`) fetch the snapshot + pane; **polling is `useRevalidator()` on an
  adaptive interval** (`web/src/hooks/use-polling.ts`); mutations are direct `lib/api.ts` calls
  followed by `revalidator.revalidate()`. There is **no TanStack Query** — don't reintroduce it.
- Routes (`web/src/router.tsx`): `/`, `/space/:spaceId`, `/settings`, `/pane/:paneId` and
  `/pane/:paneId/history`. The router instance is module-scoped so it keeps its location.
- **The idle lock pauses; it does not gate.** It only appears when Collie is left *open, visible and
  untouched* — a hidden page never locks, and returning to the foreground auto-resumes. It covers a
  still-mounted router (unmounting it ate in-progress composer drafts) and pauses polling through
  `lib/idle.ts`. Don't restore it as a security control or re-describe it as one
  ([ADR 0007](./.adr/0007-the-idle-lock-is-a-pause-not-a-gate.md)).
- **"Type into terminal" is armed by a named choice and dies with the pane view.** Long-pressing Send
  opens a menu; the hold never arms it alone. It disarms on a pane switch, a composer lock (gone pane,
  read-only, idle pause), a hidden page, and a failed batch — never persisted, never restored. Don't
  lift it, and don't add the reply guard's `composerReady` pre-flight to it; the reasoning for both
  sits in `web/src/components/send-mode-menu.tsx`'s header.
- **The operator's rows in `commands.toml` replace the shipped command catalog on the panes they
  address, never merge into it** ([ADR 0018](./.adr/0018-operator-command-rows-replace-the-catalog.md));
  the bridge re-reads the file behind an mtime check, so edits are live and need no restart.
- **PWA** via `vite-plugin-pwa` (`web/vite.config.ts`): manifest + `sw.js`, registered manually
  from `virtual:pwa-register` in `main.tsx` (bundled = CSP-safe). Install/SW need a **secure
  context** — over plain HTTP they no-op silently (Chrome insecure-origin flag, or HTTPS, to test).
- **The bundled Nerd Font subsets stay lazy and out of the precache** — `unicode-range` per face,
  version in the filename, cached first-use by `sw.ts`. Don't add them to `globPatterns`, don't
  widen a range, don't move subsetting into the build; the reasoning for each sits at the line that
  would change (`web/src/index.css`, `web/vite.config.ts`, `scripts/build-nerd-font.sh`).

## Herdr socket gotchas (see HERDR_API.md for the full, verified contract)

- RPC is **one-shot**: one request per connection; the server closes after one reply. `id` must be
  a **string**. Only `events.subscribe` streams.
- `pane.send_keys` grammar is **`+`-joined, not tmux**: `ctrl+c` (NOT `C-c`), `shift+tab`, `Up`,
  `Tab`, `Escape`, `Enter`, `Backspace`. `PageUp`/`Home`/`End`/`Delete` are unsupported.
- **A long send to Claude is verified via its paste placeholder** — anything past Claude's paste
  threshold collapses in the input box to `[Pasted text #N +M lines]`; the guard accepts that token as
  send evidence only when it is consistent with the message just typed. Don't try to dodge the
  threshold by chunking sends ([ADR 0010](./.adr/0010-long-sends-are-verified-via-the-paste-placeholder.md)).
- **A password prompt is recognised so Collie can SAY what it is, never so it can send** — no
  automatic Enter, no relaxed verification, no secret channel; the remedy offered is the operator's
  own tap on "Type" ([ADR 0017](./.adr/0017-recognising-a-password-prompt-changes-what-collie-says.md)).
  Recognition does one thing on its own: it drops the stored draft and stops persisting keystrokes.
- Pane output is rendered as **React text nodes** (never `innerHTML`); the ANSI parser only derives
  colors/weights. Keep it that way — it's the XSS boundary. Strict CSP + same-origin gate stay.
- **Collie runs no terminal emulator** — `pane.read` returns Herdr's already-rendered grid, so the
  parser needs colour and nothing else. Don't add one on either side, and don't reach for
  `terminal session observe`/`control`: a stale mirror is a transport problem, cursor position is an
  upstream ask, and `control` resizes the *shared* PTY
  ([ADR 0008](./.adr/0008-collie-does-not-run-a-terminal-emulator.md)).
- **Never use a `dark:` variant inside the mirror `<pre>`** — it tracks the root theme, which is
  backwards in a surface that renders dark under every theme and inverts in light
  ([ADR 0002](./.adr/0002-invert-the-light-terminal-mirror.md)). Fails silently;
  `ansi-output.test.tsx` guards it.
- **The plan dialog's last row is a text input, and it is never a button** — its label is only a
  placeholder while the box is empty, and its digit merely focuses the field. While `❯` sits on it the
  terminal swallows every digit as a character, so no button on that dialog may be pressable; while it
  holds text, Collie must not type into it (the caret resets to position 0, so it would prepend). A
  long value **wraps** the row rather than windowing it, which re-flows the screen above — so nothing
  may read that row as one line, and no mid-flight identity may reach above the question.
  Feedback is sent as a verified sequence, never a keystroke — the ground truth for every state is
  [`PLAN_FEEDBACK_NOTES.md`](./web/src/lib/grammar/PLAN_FEEDBACK_NOTES.md); re-walk it before touching
  `harness/claude/prompt-select.ts` or `lib/prompt-action.ts`.
- **A generically-detected menu emits only the keys the screen printed** — the footer's
  `<key> to <verb>` hints plus the arrows it advertised. Never synthesise a digit from a numbered row:
  in the `/model` picker a digit confirms *and* persists the user's default. The generic grammar
  (`harness/claude/menu.ts`) runs LAST, after every specific detector declines, and an unrecognised
  modal refuses composer typing via the adapter's `composerReady` pre-flight
  ([ADR 0009](./.adr/0009-a-generic-menu-is-driven-by-the-keys-it-names.md)).
- **A composed key queue never outlives its dock** — closing Keys discards it (guarded by a two-tap
  confirm on the drawer transition, not the ✕). Don't lift or persist it: a queue surviving into a
  later open would let Send fire a stale sequence into a pane that has moved on
  ([ADR 0005](./.adr/0005-a-composed-key-queue-never-outlives-its-dock.md)).
- **The statusline-run bound in `chrome.ts` guards less than it looks** — a dialog below the box is
  refused by the border/prompt checks and by the blank line Claude paints above its footer hint, never
  by the row count. Size it up if a real statusline needs more rows; don't delete it, and don't credit
  it with protection it doesn't provide
  ([ADR 0004](./.adr/0004-the-statusline-run-is-bounded.md)). `chrome.test.ts` pins both halves.

## The journal (scrollback the mirror can't give you)

`bridge/journal/` reads the agent's own session log off disk, per harness (`claude` / `codex` / `pi`,
registered in `registry.ts`). It is the **only** thing in the bridge that touches the filesystem, so
the containment rule in [`files.ts`](./bridge/journal/files.ts) is absolute: **every** path an
adapter is about to read goes through `containedRealpath` — after symlink resolution, on the real
paths, including paths derived from one already checked. The client never supplies a path. Run
`bun scripts/journal-probe.ts` against real logs after touching an adapter; unit tests pin the
grammar, the probe catches on-disk format drift.

## Security posture (don't regress)

Loopback bind only · exactly one hardened front door — `tailscale serve` (never `funnel`) or a
conforming reverse proxy per DEPLOYMENT.md Variant C (`COLLIE_SKIP_SERVE=1`) · same-origin gate ·
optional identity/device gates · strict CSP. A socket call can type into a real terminal — treat the bridge as
remote shell access.

**Collie manages exactly one front door: `tailscale serve`** — `collie-ctl.sh` publishes it, records
the mapping in `tailscale-managed-handler`, and only ever tears down a mapping matching that record.
Every other tunnel (NetBird, ZeroTier, Cloudflare Tunnel) is `COLLIE_SKIP_SERVE=1` + DEPLOYMENT.md
Variant E: the operator owns the ingress, Collie publishes nothing. **Don't add a second managed front
door** — [ADR 0001](./.adr/0001-one-managed-front-door.md).
