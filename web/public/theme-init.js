// Applies a pinned theme to <html> before first paint, so an explicit Light/Dark choice never
// flashes the other one on a cold load.
//
// Deliberately NOT part of the bundle: it has to run before the module graph loads. A same-origin
// <script src> is already permitted by the app's `script-src 'self'` CSP (bridge/server.ts), so
// this needs no policy change — which is the whole reason it's a file rather than an inline script.
//
// Users on System — the default — don't need this at all: `color-scheme: light dark` in index.css
// gets their first paint right with no JavaScript whatsoever. This is only for the pinned case.
//
// It only ever ADDS a class. Removing a stale one, reconciling the theme-color metas, and every
// other runtime concern belong to hooks/use-theme.ts and src/lib/design.ts. Pre-paint DOM mutation
// is how a four-line script turns into a liability, so the rule here is: read a key, check it
// against a closed list, add a class, and do nothing else whatsoever.
//
// Storage is a BARE string, not JSON — hooks/use-theme.ts must agree. JSON.stringify would write
// `"dark"` *with* the quote characters, the strict compare below would reject it, and the anti-flash
// would silently stop firing with nothing failing a test.
//
// IT NOW DOES A SECOND, IDENTICAL THING: the UI typeface (ADR 0033). Same shape, same reason — a
// reader who chose Aldrich must not watch the app paint in Space Grotesk and then change voice. The
// two are kept in one file because they are one job (get the root classes right before paint) and
// because a second blocking <script> in <head> costs a round trip on the phone this app is for.
//
// UNLIKE THE THEME, the typeface is stored as JSON — `collie:design:v1` holds an object because it
// is the seed of theming and will grow siblings (src/lib/design.ts's header says why). So this one
// parses defensively and validates the result against a CLOSED LIST before the string is allowed to
// become a class name. The list is spelled here rather than derived, because this file can import
// nothing; src/lib/design.ts holds the twin and `design.test.ts` reads BOTH files and fails if the
// key name or the class names drift apart.
//
// OPERATOR FACES GET NO PRE-PAINT PATH, deliberately. Their `@font-face` needs a family name only
// /api/config knows, so there is nothing this script could do before the network answers. A device
// set to one paints in the default shipped stack for one frame and is reconciled at store init —
// which is also exactly what it does offline, forever, without losing the preference.
