// Custom service worker (vite-plugin-pwa `injectManifest`). It does everything the old generated
// Workbox SW did — precache the app shell + SPA-fallback navigations — PLUS the two handlers a
// generated SW can't give us: `push` (render the bridge's notification) and `notificationclick`
// (deep-link to the agent). Without a `push` listener the browser, forced to show *something* for a
// `userVisibleOnly` subscription, falls back to a generic "site updated in the background" — which
// was exactly the bug this file fixes.
//
// In module scope a `declare const self` shadows the global, giving us the service-worker type (the
// documented vite-plugin-pwa pattern). `__WB_MANIFEST` is the injection point workbox-build fills in
// at build time — it must appear verbatim, exactly once, or the build fails.

// SW must never answer from the precache — the API, and the `/auth/` namespace reserved for a
// fronting proxy's sign-in page. Without that second entry an installed PWA, which has no address
// bar, has no reachable path to the proxy at all: every navigation, including a reload, is answered

// first use gives them back offline. Hand-rolled rather than workbox-strategies: the SW bundle stays
// at one dependency. Entries are never revised — the version is in the filename, so a regenerated
// subset is a different URL and old entries are swept on activate, not overwritten.
//
// The cost, stated plainly: a device that installs the PWA and goes offline without ever painting a
// Nerd Font glyph shows tofu until it is online once. Precaching would fix that by charging EVERY
// install ~1.1 MB, including the installs that never need a glyph — the wrong way round.

// login page would be cached AS the font, tofu forever with no recovery but clearing site data. So a

// the result, so it must be a monochrome silhouette on transparency. The maskable home-screen tile
// (`/web-app-manifest-192x192.png`) must never be used for either — it is opaque with no alpha, so
