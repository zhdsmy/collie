// We don't use view transitions. React Router persists an "applied view transitions" map to

// revalidation for any path it once saw a `viewTransition: true` navigation from. A device that ran an
// older Collie build (which did use them) can carry a stale entry that fires
// document.startViewTransition on every poll. Clear it on boot — our code never repopulates it. The
// `:root { view-transition-name: none }` in index.css is the belt to this: even a stray transition
// then captures nothing, so there's no visible flicker regardless of this key's name.
