// WHAT THIS IS FOR. The pane screen is the one screen that stacks two strips, and the strips are
// chrome ABOUT the pane rather than the pane's own output — 94px of it, above a mirror that on a
// keyboard-open phone shows almost nothing. Zen already answers "take it all away", and it takes the
// header and the composer with it. This is the smaller ask: keep the navigation reachable, stop
// spending a third of the chrome on it.
//
// WHY BEADS AND NOT A COUNT. A folded row must still answer the question the row answered, or it is
// just a button. The two things the strips say at a glance are "how many, and where am I in them"
// and "is anything in there shouting" — a bead per tab in the tab strip's own triage palette says
// both, and the emphasised bead is the same aria-current the tabs draw as a folder. What it does NOT
// say is the tabs' NAMES, which is the honest cost of folding and the reason expanding is one tap on
// the whole bar rather than a target you have to find.
//
// The beads are decorative on purpose (`aria-hidden`): colour is the only channel they have, so the
// button's accessible name spells the whole thing in words instead — "Show tabs and panes. 3 tabs,
// 4 panes hidden." A screen reader gets the counts; the eye gets the shape.

      // save — it was 32px and the operator read that as still heavy. 24px is the floor its contents
      // set rather than a number picked to be small: the beads are 16px boxes, so 24 leaves 4px of
      // air above and below them, and the next step down (20px) leaves 2px, which reads as a bead
      // row jammed against the header rule rather than a band with beads in it.
      //
      // The band the EYE reads (DESIGN.md §4) is exactly this box: header rule above, mirror rule
      // immediately below, 24px between them, beads centred at 4px on both sides. It was NOT — a 4px
      // page gap sat under this bar and the beads read 4px/8px, which the operator called wasted
      // pixels and was right about. That gap belonged to the open FOLDER TAB and now leaves with the
      // tabs rather than being parked on the mirror; agent-chat.tsx states the move at `mirrorGap`.
      // Nothing under this bar is unaccounted for, and nothing here pays a compensating pixel for an
      // edge that is present — which is the compensation §4 tells you to delete.
      //
      // A full-width control is the one shape that can buy its 44px floor purely as hit area with no
      // neighbour to collide with (DESIGN.md §6). 10px above and below (`-inset-y-2.5`) is
      // 24+10+10 = 44 exactly. Above is a banner or open ground; below is the mirror's own top,
      // whose only handler focuses the composer and already declines a tap that lands on a control.
      // Nothing with a target of its own is shadowed.
      // It stands in a `CollapseSwap`, whose Collapse drops its clip once settled — that is what
      // lets the ::before reach outside the box at all (see ui/collapse.tsx).
      //
      // ── AND NO `border-b`, WHICH IS THE POINT ────────────────────────────────
      // It had one, copied from the tab row, and against the mirror's own `border-t border-rule` a
      // few pixels below it that made TWO hairlines — the doubled line DESIGN.md §4 forbids, just
      // spaced far enough apart to look deliberate.
      //
      // The tab row's baseline is not a decoration this bar inherits. It exists because a FOLDER TAB
      // has to own the line it breaks: the active tab covers that baseline for its own width so the
      // tab and the content read as one piece, and the 4px below it is the page the open tab sits on
      // (tab-strip.tsx and agent-chat.tsx state both halves). Fold the rows away and there is no
      // folder tab, nothing is attached to anything, and both the line and the page go with it.
      //
      // So the seam between chrome and mirror is drawn once, by the mirror — which is the half that
      // may not move: that `border-t` is unconditional on purpose, one geometry with no state in
      // which the seam is drawn differently. This bar simply stands on the page above it.
