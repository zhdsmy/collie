      {/* This row has neither a rule of its own nor a tint of its own any more, and both went for the
          same reason: the tab bar above it is now a FOLDER tab, and the active tab is filled with the
          surface of the content it is attached to. That content is this row.

          - `border-t` would have doubled. The tab bar draws its own baseline `border-b` in --rule,
            because a folder tab has to own the line it breaks; two adjacent 1px rules composite into
            a 2px line, so the cut is drawn once, by the row above.
          - `bg-muted/20` would have broken the illusion. The active tab is `bg-background`; measured
            in dark, the tinted band sat at #101010 against the tab's #0A0A0A, so the tab read as a
            slightly darker box ON the row below rather than as one piece WITH it. The tint is a 2%
            step that was only ever separating this row from its neighbours, and the tab bar's
            baseline now does that job properly. The row is bounded above by that baseline and below
            by the mirror's own top edge.

          Its padding is still the shared one — a tighter row here would have given its pills a
          smaller tap target than the row above. */}
