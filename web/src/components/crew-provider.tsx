// Who is in the crew, made available to every write surface without threading `servers` through

//
// ── WHY A CONTEXT AND NOT A PROP ─────────────────────────────────────────────
// The hide rule ("no host chrome unless the snapshot lists more than one machine") has to live in
// ONE place, or the day a new sheet forgets it is the day a solo install grows a stray chip — and
// the day a crew install drops one is worse. `HostChip` owns the rule, which means `HostChip` needs
// the roster wherever it is mounted: inside the composer, inside a bottom sheet portalled to
// document.body, inside a long-press action list. A prop chain reaching all of those is a prop chain
// someone will break.
//
// ── WHY NOT `useRouteLoaderData(ROOT_ROUTE_ID)` ──────────────────────────────
// The roster IS on the root loader's data, so reading it there is tempting and would need no
// provider. But half the components that render a chip are unit-tested WITHOUT a router (the action
// sheets mount bare), and that hook throws outside a RouterProvider. A context with an empty default
// degrades the other way: no provider ⇒ no crew ⇒ no chrome, which is exactly the solo answer.
