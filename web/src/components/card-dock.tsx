// ── THE CARD DOCKS IN ONE SLOT (.adr/0059) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The lifted card used to render INSIDE the mirror's scroller, after the <pre>, so where its bottom
// edge landed depended on how much text stood above it, on trailing rows, and on scroll state. On a
// short screen it floated mid-page. It renders here instead: one slot in the pane view's column,
// below the mirror's scroller and directly above the chrome block (the actions belt and the input),
// outside every scroller. Every card kind, every harness, the same bottom edge.
//
// The blocks are NOT built here. AgentChat builds them once per `display` and hands the same array
// to AnsiOutput (which draws the raw blocks) and to this dock (which draws the one card), so the
// grammars run once per poll, exactly as they did when AnsiOutput built them itself.
//
// THE CARD INSTANCE SURVIVES POLLS. ADR 0056's Terminal toggle is `useState` inside PromptPanel, and
// it lasts only as long as React keeps the instance: the card is one conditional element at a fixed
// position in this dock, the same shape it had inside AnsiOutput, so a re-render of the same dialog
// reuses it and a change of kind (or the dialog leaving) resets it. Do not key the card on anything
// that changes per poll, and do not render the dock's wrapper conditionally on anything but "is
// there a card" — either would remount the card and drop the operator's Terminal choice.
