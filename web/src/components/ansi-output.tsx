// terminal's own output — and is marked by an underline in `currentColor`, which is legible against
// whatever the mirror's background is under either theme.
//
// `py-[0.35em]` is the tap target, and it is free: vertical padding on an INLINE box doesn't grow
// the line box, so the mirror's height and the terminal grid are identical with or without it
// (measured: same <pre> height either way) while the hit area goes from ~14px to ~22px on a phone.
// It must stay em-relative and small, and the reason is NOT that the padded box fits the line box —
// it doesn't: ~14px of content plus 2x4.2px of padding is ~22px against a 15px line advance, so it
// overlaps its neighbours by design. Two things make that safe, and both must hold:
//   1. The pad never reaches the neighbouring line's CENTRE at any size the A+/A- control offers.
//      A px value tuned for 12px text would, at the 9px floor — and a tap on ordinary output would
//      silently open a link. This is why it stays em-relative.
//   2. Where the overlap does cover the next line's text, that line's spans come later in DOM order
//      and win inline hit-testing, so a tap on visible text goes to the text. Only empty space
//      beside a link can bleed to the anchor.
// Don't convert it to a px value, and don't "fix" it to fit the line box — that would undo (1).

// (blocks.ts): parseAnsi → styled lines → typed blocks → React. Text is always rendered as React
// text nodes (escaped); only color/weight come from the ANSI parse — no XSS surface.
//
// For a Claude pane the AST may lift the tail into a `prompt-select` block (native buttons) and strip
// the agent's own input-box chrome; everything else stays a `raw` block that reproduces exactly what
// the flat renderer produced (one <span> per segment, "\n" text nodes between lines). Raw blocks go
// inside the <pre>; the prompt-select block renders after it as its own button group.
//
// Find-in-output highlights matches over the RAW blocks only — the prompt-select block's text is
// rendered as buttons, not searchable mirror text. The haystack is the concatenation of the raw
// blocks' line text (newlines included), and the renderer threads a running offset through
// blocks → lines → segments so each segment maps back to that same coordinate space. (A find query
// can't contain a newline, so no match straddles the inter-line separators.)
//
// Autolinked URLs (lib/links.ts) live in that SAME coordinate space and are applied over the raw
// blocks too, as anchors wrapping the find-highlighted runs. Only `http(s)://` text becomes a link,
// and the href is the matched text itself — no scheme can appear that wasn't printed by the agent.
//
// Performance: parseAnsi + block-building run once per unique `text` (and `agent`) value (useMemo),
// as does the link scan; React.memo prevents re-renders when props are unchanged — critical for the
// polling cadence on mobile. With no query and no links the render skips splitSegment entirely and
// emits the segment's own string, exactly as the pre-find flat renderer did.
