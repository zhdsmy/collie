// and each row still carrying its own place on line 2 — those two groups are by URGENCY, so a row
// in them has to say where it came from. That is the dashboard's job and it does not move.
//
// THEN, everything else, BY WORKSPACE. One group per workspace, headed by its name and counted, in
// machine and workspace-number order (lib/pane-groups.ts), with the panes inside in the order the
// bridge sent. What this replaces is the Working and Recent sections, and the argument for replacing
// them is the complaint they caused: a flat list of eighteen rows, each repeating an address, said
// nothing about what KIND of thing a row was, and a status word the row's own dot already carries
// is a poor heading to spend a group on. Rows under one workspace heading are panes, because that is
// what a workspace holds. The workspace is the level the operator thinks in, so it is the level the
// heading names; the tab drops onto line 2 of the row (`AgentCard` at `scope="place"`), where it
// tells two rows apart without spending a heading, and the group reads as one 44px pitch.
//
// A ROW IS LISTED ONCE. An urgent pane is PULLED out of its workspace rather than copied to the top:
// it is one thing, and two rows for it would mean answering it twice. So the group's count counts
// the rows actually under the heading, and a workspace whose every pane needs you has no group left
// at all — it is entirely on top, which is where you are already looking.
//
// The sort toggle and the Recent fold went with those two sections: a workspace's handful of rows is
// not a tail to fold away, and there is no clock left in the order to reverse.
