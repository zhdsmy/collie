 * The enclosing surface for an up-levelled dialog: a bordered, filled panel that lifts the WHOLE
 * prompt off the raw terminal mirror behind it — the primary "these are controls, not output"
 * signal, shared by all six block renderers so the separation can't drift. `bg-card` sits one
 * layer above the page background in dark (the terminal is on `--background`, the option rows on the
 * lighter `--secondary`, so the panel reads as a distinct middle layer); in light, where card ==
 * background, the border + shadow carry the separation. Owns `role="group"` + its aria label, so a
 * block's outermost element IS this panel.
 *
 * ADR 0056: a card that carries `raw` (the block's own `lines` — the region it replaced) also
 * carries the way back to it. A ghost "Terminal" control swaps the panel's children for a
 * `RawMirror` of `raw` and a "Back to the card" control; the choice is local `useState`, so it
 * lasts exactly as long as this component instance — React keeps that instance across polls
 * because the caller renders each card kind as one conditional element at a fixed position
 * (ansi-output.tsx), and a fresh dialog is a fresh instance. Never persisted, never a device pref
 * — that's the always-on `rawTerminal` display setting, which stays exactly as it was. Omitting
 * `raw` (or leaving it `undefined`) renders no control at all, unchanged from before this ADR.
 *
 * `rawMode` names what the control actually does, because it does two different things depending
 * on the card. Four cards go from nothing to the region on tap — the default, `"reveal"` — so
 * "Show the terminal instead of this card" is true there. The generic-menu and unread-dialog
 * cards already show the mirror by default; their control only hides THEIR OWN buttons, the
 * mirror stays equivalent either way, so they pass `"declutter"`, which renames both controls to
 * say that ("Put away" / "Show the buttons") rather than claim a swap that isn't happening.
