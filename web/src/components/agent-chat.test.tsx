// it the mirror carries `min-h-0 flex-1`, so the mirror is the row that gives — and it gives all
// the way to zero. Everything below it is content-sized, so once the mirror is at zero the surplus
// paints past the bottom edge of the viewport, under the soft keyboard, and the send button becomes
// unreachable. With the keyboard up a phone has ~440px of page and the un-shrinkable rows wanted
// ~454px.

// The repair is NOT to let the bottom shrink — nothing inside it scrolls, so it would clip the
// composer instead of overflowing it, which is the same loss with a tidier edge. The repair is to
// BOUND the two parts of it that grow, and to bound them as a fraction of the viewport rather than
// at a constant. `dvh` already tracks the soft keyboard, because the viewport meta is
// `interactive-widget=resizes-content` (hooks/use-keyboard.ts says so from the other side), so one
// unit does the job on every device instead of encoding one phone's pixels.
