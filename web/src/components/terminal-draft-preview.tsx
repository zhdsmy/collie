// A read-only preview of a draft stranded on the terminal's "❯" line (a message queued then recalled
// on the HOST, which stripChrome hides from the mirror). The composer input is exclusively phone-owned
// — a host draft is NEVER written into it implicitly. Instead we surface it here and let the user
// deliberately Take over (copy it into the composer) so the two live input surfaces never fight. Its
// TEXT tracks the live line, so watching the host type streams straight into this block; that can't
// glitch the phone's field because nothing here feeds back into it. There is no dismiss: the preview is
// honest state — a draft really is stranded on the host's line — so it persists until the user takes it
// over, sends a message (which sweeps the host line), or the host line clears on its own. Same
// zinc/text-xs chip chrome as the composer's "You sent:" strip; the draft body clamps to a few readable
// lines. Take over is withdrawn (not disabled-looking, just absent) when the line is only the harness's
// own paste placeholder — see `onTakeOver`.
