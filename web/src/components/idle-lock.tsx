// The cover shown while the idle lock is engaged. It sits ABOVE a still-mounted router (see App), so
// resuming returns you to the exact screen, draft and scroll position you left — nothing is unmounted
// and nothing is rebuilt.
//
// It is deliberately GLASS rather than opaque. The cover's job is to say "this is frozen, not live" —
// a paused mirror read as a current one is the actual hazard — and it does that better while the herd
// stays legible underneath: you can see WHAT is stale instead of losing the screen entirely. The
// trade is that an unattended screen no longer hides agent output; that's accepted, because the
// device's own screen lock is the thing that was ever going to handle shoulder-surfing.
//
// It leads with the Collie mark for a plain reason: this is the one screen in the app with no header,
// no herd chrome and no nav, so without the badge a full-viewport panel is unattributable — it could
// be any app that happened to be open. The mark is the STATIC app icon, never <DogGallop/>: that
// sprite's rest frame is a full-stretch mid-stride pose that reads as "frozen mid-run", and this
// screen is the app's most literal rest state.
//
// No lock iconography and no "for safety" — the pause guards nothing (.adr/0007). Saying otherwise
// would promise a gate that a page reload has always walked straight through.
