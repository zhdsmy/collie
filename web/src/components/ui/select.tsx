/**
 * The app's form select: a NATIVE `<select>` in a 44px box with our own chevron. Native on purpose,
 * for the reason `language-control.tsx` gives: on a phone the OS draws the picker, it is the control
 * every thumb already knows, and it needs no popover (`ui/sheet.tsx` is the app's only floating
 * layer). The engine's caret is removed with `appearance-none` and the chevron is ours, because iOS
 * Safari keeps its own caret and padding otherwise.
 *
 * The box is a full border on all four sides in `--border`, the page colour inside and the house
 * 2px corner. The text truncates, so a long option never widens the box it sits in. `min-h-11` is
 * the tap floor (DESIGN.md §6), and nothing about the select changes its box when the value does
 * (§2): the native control sizes itself to its widest option, not to the chosen one.
 *
 * The first user is the "New agent on a branch" sheet's Repository and Agent fields
 * (`new-space-sheet.tsx`); the dashboard's workspace and order selects are the second. The three
 * Settings selects (language, typeface, terminal font) carry the same construction by hand and have
 * not been moved onto this yet.
