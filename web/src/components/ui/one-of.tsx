/**
 * One box, several alternatives, exactly one of them shown — and the box is as big as the BIGGEST
 * of them, always.
 *
 * This is the app's answer to DESIGN.md §2 for the case the transparent-border technique cannot
 * reach. §2's canonical fix reserves an *edge*; it says nothing about a run of TEXT whose word
 * changes with the state. "needs you" is 54.6px and "done" is 27.9px, so a strip that renders one
 * or the other has two widths, and everything beside it moves when the state changes. Reserving a
 * pixel number is not a fix either: the same slot is "braucht dich" (72.2px) in German and
 * "desconocido" (70.0px) in Spanish, so any constant clips one language or wastes space in another.
 *
 * The technique: every alternative is rendered, all of them in ONE grid cell (`[grid-area:1/1]`),
 * and the losers are held at `opacity-0`. The cell is therefore sized by the widest and tallest
 * occupant IN THE ACTIVE LOCALE, computed by the layout engine from the real glyphs, and a change
 * of `active` is a repaint of the cell rather than a resize of it. Nothing measures anything, and
 * there is no number to keep up to date.
 *
 * `ui/strip-host.tsx` is where this idiom was first written, for the band above the header, and it
 * is the reason this file exists rather than a second copy of those six lines: DESIGN.md §1 says
 * the primitive lands the moment a second place needs the same visual idea. The band still owns
 * everything ABOVE the idiom — which slot wins, the dissolve between them, the ghost it keeps
 * painting while it collapses, the two permanent live regions — and hands only the stacking here.
 *
 * A loser is `inert` AND `aria-hidden`. `inert` is the load-bearing one and the reason `hidden`
 * would not do: a losing layer may hold a focusable control (the band's Retry button), and taking
 * something out of the accessibility tree without also taking it out of the tab order is the worse
 * of the two bugs. `aria-hidden` rides along because `inert` is younger than the oldest engine this
 * PWA runs on, and because a test renderer with no layout still honours it.
 *
 * Alignment INSIDE the cell is the caller's: pass `justify-items-end` for a run that hugs a right
 * edge, `justify-items-start` for one anchored on the left. The primitive states no opinion, the
 * same way it states no opinion about tone — where the reserved space falls is a fact about the
 * strip, not about stacking.
 *
 * **Every layer carries `min-w-0`, for the reason `ui/collapse.tsx` states at length: a grid
 * item's automatic minimum size is its content on BOTH axes.** `[grid-area:1/1]` makes each layer a
 * grid item of the single implicit column, and without an explicit override that column's `auto`
 * track sizes to the WIDEST layer's min-content width — which, for a `white-space: nowrap` run (a
 * truncating strip's own copy), is the whole unbroken sentence, since nowrap forbids the line break
 * that would otherwise give it a smaller one. Measured on the update band at 375px: the column
 * computed to 497px, the strip laid out at that width, and the `overflow-hidden` ancestor two levels
 * up (`ui/collapse.tsx`'s inner wrapper) then clipped the excess HARD, past the ellipsis the strip's
 * own `truncate` span never got a chance to draw, because the span was never forced narrower than
 * its content in the first place — a real phone showed a sentence cut off mid-word, and jsdom could
 * not: it never runs this algorithm. `min-w-0` here is what lets the column shrink to the space this
 * primitive actually has, so a caller's `truncate` inside it truncates against a real number.
