/**
 * The 44px tap floor for a notice's action button, bought as HIT area so the band stays thin.
 *
 * Same technique and same trap as `STRIP_TAP_TARGET` in `ui/labelled-strip.tsx`: a transparent
 * `::before` reaches past the drawn box, so a 24px button answers a 44px touch while the strip
 * still measures 33px. Three numbers hold it together and all three are load-bearing:
 *
 *  1. **`h-6` is 24px drawn**, which is what connection-banner's Retry already is, and it is the
 *     number the strip's and box's floors below are DERIVED from. Change it and re-derive them.
 *  2. **`-inset-y-[11px]`, not `-inset-y-2.5` (10px).** An absolutely positioned child resolves its
 *     insets against the PADDING box, and every `ui/button.tsx` carries the 1px transparent border
 *     that DESIGN.md §2 reserves. So the padding box of an `h-6` button is 22px, not 24, and 10px
 *     each way measures 42 — the floor missed by 2px, invisibly. 11px reaches a true 44. A control
 *     that is NOT a Button (no reserved border) reaches 46 here, which is fine; under is not.
 *  3. **An ancestor with `overflow: hidden` eats the extension**, taps and all, with nothing to
 *     see. That is why `ui/collapse.tsx` drops its clip once it has finished opening: the strip
 *     band is 33px and the reach is 11px, so every pixel of this target is outside the collapsed
 *     box it animates inside of.
 *
 * The tap floor is not negotiable, and the strip's floor is derived FROM this button — the strip
 * accommodates the target, never the other way round.

/**
 * A strip is a full-bleed one-liner of viewport chrome, and it NEVER wraps — by contract, not by
 * luck. The copy goes in a single `min-w-0 flex-1 truncate` span below, so no string a feature
 * passes can turn a 33px band into a 49px one behind its back.
 *
 * **The floor: `min-h-[33px]`.** It is derived, not picked. 24px (the `h-6` action button, the
 * tallest thing a strip may legitimately contain) + this row's own `py-1` (2×4px) + the 1px tinted
 * `border-b`, which `border-box` counts INSIDE a min-height. 24+8+1 = 33. The next person will want
 * to tidy that into a round 32; the 1px they would be dropping is the rule that separates this band
 * from the header under it, and dropping it puts the jump back.
 *
 * Why state a floor at all: without one a strip is exactly as tall as whatever it happens to
 * contain, so a text-only "Reconnecting…" row renders SHORTER than an outage row carrying Retry,
 * and the band changes height as the session degrades. That is the 60px/56px header jump this
 * codebase already fixed once (DESIGN.md §6), one band higher up.
 *
 * Why `min-height` and NOT `height`, which is the same reason on record at app-header.tsx:100-109:
 * a future child taller than the floor must GROW the strip — visibly, in every place that mounts
 * one, so somebody has to look at the decision — rather than be clipped or overflow it silently.
 * The `py-1` stays so that taller child keeps its 4px of breathing room.
 *
 * **`w-full` stays HERE and is load-bearing, unlike the box's** (see BOX below, where it was the
 * fault). Two reasons, both measured in Chrome at 390px. First, the `onActivate` shape renders this
 * root as a `<button>`, and a button sizes itself to its content even at `display: flex` and even as
 * a stretch-aligned grid item — the whole-surface "new version, tap to update" row came out **160px
 * wide instead of 390** without it, i.e. a tap target the width of its own sentence. Second, a
 * percentage width can only collide with a margin, and a strip never carries one: it is full-bleed
 * by definition and `ui/strip-host.tsx` owns the row it sits in, so there is no gutter for the 100%
 * to be offset by. Both halves of that are what the box cannot say for itself.
 *
 * No safe-area inset here. The band's top inset belongs to `ui/strip-host.tsx`, which owns the row;
 * three of the current strips carry it and one does not, which is exactly the drift a shared owner
 * ends. The FLOOR, by contrast, does belong here and not on the host: it is derived from the action
 * slot's button, which is this component's contract, and it is tone-tinted through the `border-b`,
 * which the host is deliberately blind to.

/**
 * A box is content, not chrome: inset on the page gutter, full border, 2px corner (`rounded-sm` —
 * DESIGN.md §3, and where in doubt go sharper). The caller supplies the gutter, `mx-4 mt-3`, since
 * only the caller knows what it sits between.
 *
 * Unlike a strip a box WRAPS freely, and should: a two-line "this host has not checked in since…"
 * is two lines of true information, and truncating it would be a lie about a standing condition.
 *
 * **The same floor, box-shaped: `min-h-[42px]`.** 24px (the first-line slot, sized by the same
 * `h-6` action button) + `py-2` (2×8px) + the box's 2×1px border under `border-box`. 24+16+2 = 42.
 * Growth ABOVE the floor is legitimate; two ONE-LINE boxes differing because one carries an icon
 * and the other does not is the fault this closes.
 *
 * `items-start`, not `items-center`: a wrapping body wants its icon on the first line, not floating
 * beside the middle of a paragraph. A single line is then centred against the 24px first-line slot
 * by the body's own `min-h-6` (below), so a lone line sits optically centred instead of top-heavy —
 * both alignments, from one rule, without a conditional class that would make the box two heights.
 *
 * **No width utility, deliberately — a `w-full` here EATS the gutter it just asked the caller for.**
 * The two sentences above are in direct contradiction with a 100% width: a margin does not shrink a
 * percentage, it offsets it. Measured in Chrome at a 390px viewport with `mx-4`: `w-full` gave a box
 * **390px wide starting 16px in**, so 16px hung past the right edge, clipped, and the right gutter
 * was simply gone; without it the same box measures **358px with 16px on both sides**. Nothing is
 * bought by the class either — this root is a block-level flex container, which already fills its
 * line box and already shrinks by its own margins, so the fix is an absence and not a substitution.
 * (The strip's `w-full` is a different case and stays — see STRIP above. The one shape that would
 * still need a width here is a box with `onActivate`, whose root is a `<button>` and therefore
 * content-sized: 162px at 390px, measured. No caller writes that combination — whole-surface tap is
 * a strip affordance — and the answer when one does is `width: stretch`, which fills what the margin
 * leaves, NOT a return to `w-full`.)
