/**
 * THE BRANCH, on one line: a branch glyph and the name, or a commit glyph and `detached @abc1234`.
 *
 * A long name gives way IN THE MIDDLE and keeps its tail, because the tail is what tells
 * `perf/dashboard-poll-cadence-and-backoff` from `perf/dashboard-poll-cadence-and-jitter`: two spans,
 * the head truncates and the last {@link TAIL} characters never do. The name is mono, because a branch
 * is a machine identifier read character by character (DESIGN.md §5, mono vs sans), at 11px with a
 * 16px line box, the size it takes on every surface. The caller sets the line box on a surface whose
 * line is shorter (`leading-3` in the pane header) and the width it may take.
 *
 * The glyph is centred on its own (`self-center`) and stays out of the baseline, so the label's
 * baseline is its TEXT's: a line that sets its items on the baseline (the pane header) puts the name
 * on the same baseline as the workspace beside it. With the glyph in the baseline, the label reported
 * the glyph's bottom edge and the name sat about 2px high.
 *
 * The drawn text is hidden from a screen reader, which reads the whole name in words instead
 * ("Branch fix-login"), since the eye's version may be cut. Owns no tap: a caller that wants one
 * wraps it.
