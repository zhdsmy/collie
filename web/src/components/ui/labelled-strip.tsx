/**
 * The 44px tap floor for a strip pill, bought without a single pixel of drawn height.
 *
 * A transparent `::before` extends the button's HIT box above and below its drawn box, so a 34px
 * pill answers a 46px touch while the row still measures 34px. Nothing about the pill's paint, its
 * 2px corner or its box changes, in any state — so this survives both the no-shift rule (C1) and
 * the `border-transparent` recipe untouched.
 *
 * Two measured numbers hold this together, and both are load-bearing:
 *
 *  1. **`-7px`, not `-6px`.** An absolutely positioned child resolves its insets against the
 *     button's PADDING box, and every pill here carries the C1 1px transparent border. At `-6px`
 *     the reach past the visible edge is therefore 5px, not 6, and the hit box came out at exactly
 *     34+5+5 = 44 — the floor with nothing to spare. `-7px` reaches a true 6px and measures 46.
 *  2. **6px is the scroller's `py-1.5` below, and the extension may not exceed it.** `overflow-x:
 *     auto` forces `overflow-y` to compute to `auto` (measured — the scroller is a scroll container
 *     on BOTH axes), so anything past the scroller's padding box is clipped away and stops taking
 *     taps. Verified by `document.elementFromPoint`: before the padding moved here, a probe 2px
 *     above a chip hit the <nav>, not the chip. That is why the row's vertical padding was moved off
 *     the <nav> and off the label and onto the scroller — the same pixels, but now inside the clip
 *     boundary where a tap area can use them.
 *
 * So: change `py-1.5` below, or add/remove the pill's border, and re-measure this inset. Get it
 * wrong in one direction and the floor silently drops; wrong in the other and the scroller grows a
 * vertical scrollbar.

 * chrome above the mirror was 231px, 27% of the viewport, and 126px of it was the two strips. The
 * words TABS and PANES restate the header, so on this route only they are dropped from the paint
 * and kept in the a11y tree via `sr-only` — the `aria-labelledby` pairing is untouched, so the rows
 * are still named "Tabs" and "Panes" to a screen reader.
 *
 * That takes each strip to 47px: 1px top rule + the scroller's 6+34+6. That is the FLOOR, not a
 * guess — the scroller's `py-1.5` is the room the pills' 44px tap area reaches into (see
 * STRIP_TAP_TARGET), so it cannot be trimmed further without dropping the tap floor. Nothing else on
 * this row is removable.

// The structural half of the "name the row" pattern: a horizontally scrolling strip of pills with
// its name on the line ABOVE, not beside.
//
// Three things are load-bearing here, and each of them is why this is a component rather than a
// prop on `SectionLabel` — a <span> can restructure none of them:
//
//  1. **The label sits OUTSIDE the scroller.** Inline, it is the scroller's first child, so it
//     scrolls away with the pills and the row loses its only name half way through a gesture. The
//     outer element does not scroll; the inner one does.
//  2. **`aria-labelledby` pairs the two.** Inline, the label was a stray word in front of an
//     unnamed run of buttons — the row had no accessible name at all. The id is generated here so
//     the pairing cannot be forgotten at a fourth strip later.
//  3. **`-mx-4 px-4` makes the scroller edge-to-edge.** The padding moves from the outer element
//     onto the scroller and is then cancelled by a negative margin, so the last pill can scroll
//     clean off the screen instead of stopping 16px short, while the first pill still starts
//     aligned under the label. The two halves are ONE number and must move together: the route's
//     gutter. It is 16px (`px-4`) everywhere under R2 — one left edge per route — so a pill's left
//     edge lands on the same x as the content column beside it. Change one half alone and the row
//     either stops short of the screen edge or starts its first pill off the gutter.
//  4. **The row's VERTICAL padding lives on the scroller too, for the same kind of reason.** The
//     scroller clips on both axes (see STRIP_TAP_TARGET), so padding parked on the <nav> is padding
//     the pills' tap areas cannot reach. Moved inside, the same pixels become the 44px floor. The
//     <nav> keeps only `pt-1.5`, which sits above the label and is genuinely the label's air.
//
// The typography stays in `SectionLabel` (`placement="above"`), so Spaces · Tabs · Panes · Controls
// cannot drift apart. This owns the structure; that owns the word.
