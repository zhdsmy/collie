  // ── COMPOSING MODE — read ONCE, here, for the whole pane ──────────────────────
  // The soft keyboard takes roughly 45% of a phone. What is left has to hold the header, the tab
  // strip, the agent's statusline, the grab handle, the status band, the controls row and the draft
  // — and the operator measured the result: the mirror shows ZERO rows of what the agent said while
  // three rows of cache percentages hold their ground, and the send button lands under the keyboard.
  //
  // So two rows stand down while the keyboard is up, and both are chosen on the same test: is this
  // read BEFORE typing, or DURING it? The pane switcher is read before — nobody switches panes
  // mid-sentence — and the statusline is reference data. Both come back untouched the instant the
  // keyboard closes, which is a state the operator causes and understands.
  //
  // WHAT DOES NOT STAND DOWN IS THE STATUS BAND, and that is the operator's own suggestion declined
  // with a reason. It is 14px, the cheapest row on the screen, and it is the only place the pane's
  // state is spelled as a WORD rather than a coloured dot — which is why it exists (WCAG 1.4.1,
  // status-badge.tsx holds the measurement). It is also read at exactly this moment: it answers
  // "is this agent even waiting for me?" while the thumb is over Send. The 30px handle and the
  // 21–112px statusline are 4–8x the pixels at none of the cost.
  //
  // Read once and passed down, never called again in a child: two components calling this hook
  // separately is two thresholds, two ideas of when the mode starts, and one boundary animating out
  // of step with itself.

  // ── THE FOLDED STRIPS, AND THE ONE STATE THAT OVERRIDES THE PREFERENCE ────────

  // toggle, not two: they are one band of "chrome about the pane", they leave in one gesture, and a
  // screen where the operator can hide the tabs but not the panes is a setting, not a fold.
  //
  // TWO TIERS AGAIN, AND THE SPLIT IS NOT ZEN'S. `stripsPref` is the operator's device-level choice
  // (lib/strips-collapsed.ts) and it persists. `keyboardFold` is the transient override that exists
  // only while the soft keyboard is up, and NOTHING about it is written down.
  //
  // Why the keyboard wins by default: the keyboard takes roughly 45% of the phone, and the rows are
  // read BEFORE typing, never during it — the same test `composing` above applies to the pane
  // switcher and the statusline, reached here for the same reason and answered the same way. So
  // while the keyboard is up the rows stand down whatever the preference says.
  //
  // Why the override may not persist: an expand taken with the keyboard up is the operator saying
  // "I need to see the tabs right now", not "show me the tabs from now on". Writing it would let one
  // mid-sentence tap redefine every future pane. It therefore resets the moment the keyboard closes,
  // and a fold taken in that state writes nothing either — it already matches the state the keyboard
  // imposes, so there is nothing to record.
  const stripsPref = useStripsCollapsed();
  const [keyboardFold, setKeyboardFold] = useState<boolean | null>(null);
  // ── AND WHOSE KEYBOARD IT IS, WHICH `composing` CANNOT ANSWER ────────────────
  // `useKeyboardOpen` watches the viewport, so it says a keyboard is up and never says what asked
  // for it — correct for the switcher and the statusline, which spend pixels the keyboard took
  // whoever is typing. It is NOT enough here, because THE THING THAT FOLDS CONTAINS AN INPUT: the
  // tab and pane actions sheets are rendered by TabStrip/PaneStrip, inside this band, and their
  // rename field autofocuses. The operator taps Rename, the field's own keyboard opens, `composing`
  // flips, the band folds, and 240ms later `Collapse` unmounts the strip — taking the sheet and the
  // half-typed name with it. Nothing can be renamed on a phone at all. (The sheets stay in the band
  // deliberately: they belong to the row that owns them. The gate is the fix, not a hoist.)
  //
  // So the auto-fold asks the second question too: is this the COMPOSER's keyboard? Only the
  // composer's field is down at the bottom under the space this band would give back; a keyboard
  // raised by anything else took its pixels from somewhere else and buys no fold here.
  //
  // OWNERSHIP IS LATCHED, not read live, and that is not an optimisation. Focus leaves the composer
  // for every control the operator touches while typing — including the summary bar that puts these
  // rows BACK — and a live read would hand the band back to `stripsPref` mid-gesture and let that

                  the air moved from outside the block to inside it. Each line states its own height
                  (20 / 12) so the block is a sum of boxes: as bare inline spans they inherit the
                  body's 1.45 strut and the block silently becomes taller than the row was measured
                  for.

                  THE CAPTION LINE IS GONE, and the word it held is not. Line 1 carried the status
                  word alone once the host left for the composer, so the top of the pane spent a
                  whole line of a 60px row on one word — the operator asked for that top back. The
                  word DID NOT get deleted with the line: simulated on the app's own `--status-*`
                  tokens, a deuteranope reads blocked / working / done as ONE colour in light theme
                  and "needs you" against "done" collapses in BOTH, so a dot alone cannot carry this
                  range and deleting the word would have re-opened that failure (status-badge.tsx
                  states the measurement). It moved DOWN, onto the composer's status strip beside the
                  host, where "which machine, and what is it doing" reads as one sentence at the
                  surface you are typing into. The dot badged onto the agent's tile above STAYS — it
                  is the anchor that welds the state to its subject, and its ring is what separates
                  it from the Claude tile's own orange.

                  The row does not shrink for the missing line: `min-h-15` is a FLOOR (app-header.tsx),
                  36px of lines centred in it still measures 60px, and that floor is shared by every
                  route and must not be lowered to fit this one. */}

                    column, centred against both lines, which spent the block's entire left edge on it
                    and pushed the path in under the name with nothing above it. On line 1 it reads as
                    what it is — a mark ON the name, the way a favicon sits on a title — and line 2
                    reclaims the full width of the block for the path.

                    16px, not the 24px it was. Beside 16px semibold text, inside a 20px line box, and
                    in a row that also holds the 32px Collie mark: the pane's subject may be the thing
                    the eye lands on and may not be the heaviest mark in the header.

                    The subject carries the state BADGED onto its corner — `agent-card.tsx`'s pattern,
                    not a new one. In dark theme the Claude tile's orange (oklch 0.672 0.131 39) and
                    --status-blocked (0.700 0.200 24) are 0.028 apart in lightness and 15° in hue: as
                    two loose marks on one line they are one colour, and "blocked" — the state that
                    most needs to be seen — would disappear into the subject glyph. The ring separates
                    them physically instead of by tuning colours. The dot drops to 8px with the tile,
                    so the badge stays a badge instead of swallowing the mark it sits on.

                    The line states its own 20px height either way (`items-center` over a 16px mark in
                    a 20px line box), so the block is still 20 + 4 + 12 and the header row's floor is
                    untouched — DESIGN.md §2. A user-set pane label leads when present (the identifier
                    they chose), then Claude's own /rename session name, otherwise the default
                    space › tab. */}

                      The pill row below prints this same suffix in this same face (`font-mono
                      text-[10px]`, lib/pane-tag.ts), so the eye matches header to pill without being
                      told. Not the pill's `/60` alpha though: that is calibrated against the pill's
                      own `bg-muted` fill, and here the suffix sits 4px above a `text-muted-foreground`
                      cwd line on the page ground, where two alphas of one grey read as a rendering
                      fault rather than as a hierarchy.

                      `leading-5` is stated, not inherited, for the reason every other line box here
                      states its own: the block is a SUM of boxes (20 + 4 + 12) that app-header.tsx's
                      row floor is sized against, and a span that falls back to the body's 1.45 strut
                      grows line 1 past 20px and the header row with it — on the pane route alone.

                      It is not in the button's aria-label, and that is not an omission: the label
                      names what the button DOES ("Open webapp overview — needs you"), not what the
                      pane is called, and a suffix that exists to be matched against pills two rows
                      down has nothing to say to a reader who is hearing the row rather than seeing
                      it. */}

              that rule governs a surface IN FLOW, whose arrival pushes its neighbours around. This
              one is `absolute`, holds no space, and moves nothing — §2 has nothing to say about it
              either. It is the first child of this region so it leads the tab order, which matters
              because it is the only structural control left in zen, and it is anchored to the region
              rather than to the mirror because the mirror's top neighbour renders nothing when idle:
              anchored there, the one way out would slide down by the height of a toast and back up

              translucent page colour: in dark `--background` IS the mirror's own fill

              title slot (HeaderStatus, wrapped around RouteHeader's children above), because a toast

              (the newest output, the reason the screen is open) was tried on this very screen even
              earlier and reverted too — see ToastViewport's own doc for that experiment.

              ── WHY THIS IS 4px AND NOT 0, WHICH IS WHAT WAS ASKED FOR ──────────────────
              The operator wanted the tab row denser and chose this gap over shrinking the tab, which
              was the right call: the tab is `h-11` and that 44px IS the tap target, so every pixel
              off the tab is a pixel off the thumb. This gap costs no target at all. But it cannot go
              to ZERO, and the reason is measured and sits three paragraphs below: the active tab's
              fill and the terminal's ground are byte-identical under BOTH themes, on purpose, so
              with no page between them the open tab has no floor and bleeds into the mirror. Closed
              flush, the baseline rule and the mirror's top rule also land adjacent and read as one
              doubled 2px hairline, which DESIGN.md §4 forbids by name.
              4px keeps both properties — the tab still opens onto page, and the two rules still read
              as two boundaries — and returns half the gap. It is the whole saving available above
              the tap floor on this row; the row itself is 45px and 44 of that is the target.

              The tab above is deliberately open at its bottom edge: that is what makes it a tab and
              not a pill, and a tab opening downward promises continuity with the surface beneath it.
              Beneath it here is the terminal mirror, which is a FOREIGN surface — a fixed ANSI
              palette the light theme inverts wholesale (components/mirror-space.ts). Worse, the two
              grounds are byte-identical on purpose: `--background` is oklch(0.145) = #0a0a0a in dark,
              which is MIRROR_SPACE's own fill, and oklch(0.97) = rgb(245) in light, which is exactly
              what that fill inverts to (index.css:44-48 says so, and closing the mirror's seam
              against the page is why the value was chosen). So the active tab's `bg-background` fill
              and the terminal ground were literally the same colour, under both themes: the tab had
              no floor and read as bleeding into the terminal.

              The fix is not a second rule at the tab's baseline. That was tried and is wrong twice
              over: the baseline already carries one, and the active tab covers it for its own width
              with a 1px cover strip, so a rule drawn flush from below is a pixel the tab cannot
              reach and shows through under the open tab. The fix is to give the tab something of its
              own to sit on. `mt-1` is 4px of PAGE below the baseline — the tab now opens onto the
              page, which is what a folder tab's open edge promises — and `border-t` is then the
              mirror's own top edge, clear of the baseline, so the two lines read as two
              boundaries and never as one doubled hairline. (It was 8px; see the header for why it
              is now 4 and why it may not be 0.)

              It costs nothing. `ChatMessageList` below dropped the matching 12px of scroller
              `pt` in the same edit: the padding was invisible (page colour on page colour when at
              the top of the buffer, and gone entirely the moment the mirror follows the tail, which
              is nearly always), so 12px of nothing became 9px of an actual boundary — the stack
              above the first terminal glyph got 3px SHORTER. A terminal draws to its own edges;
              flush against its top rule is the honest rendering, and the bottom keeps its `pb-3`
              because the tail wants clearance from the composer.

              THE RULE IS UNCONDITIONAL. THE GAP IS NOT, AND THE SPLIT IS THE WHOLE POINT.
              `border-t border-rule` is drawn in every state, always, at the same weight: it is the
              mirror's own top edge and the one seam between chrome and output, so there is no state
              in which that boundary is drawn differently (DESIGN.md §2). Whether PaneStrip renders,
              whether the strips are folded, whether zen took the band entirely — the line is there.
              What moves is the 4px above it (`mirrorGap`, stated where `folded` is), because that
              4px was never the mirror's: it is the page an open FOLDER TAB sits on, and it exists
              only while a folder tab does. Folded, the tab row is gone and the bead bar that stands
              in for it is not attached to anything, so the page it would sit on is dead space — the
              operator read it as such. Nothing about the seam changes; only who is standing on it. */}

                          the alternate screen, which keeps no scrollback ring, so the mirror can never

                          that exists (see bridge/transcript.ts).
                        • a pane with real scrollback (a shell, on the primary screen) → "Load older",
                          which grows the requested window.

              the pane-switch handle, the composer. The connection status line USED to float here as an
              overlay just above the composer, but it covered the terminal tail (the prompt/cursor and
              up-levelled prompt buttons) — it now lives as a slim row just below the header.

              ── `shrink-0`, STATED, AND WHY IT IS NOT `min-h-0` ──────────────────────────
              This is the flex sibling of the mirror inside a `h-[100dvh]` column. The mirror above
              carries `min-h-0 flex-1`, so IT is the row that gives — and it gives all the way to
              zero. What happens after that is what the operator reported as "the bottom is cut off":
              nothing else in this column can shrink, so the surplus paints past the bottom edge of
              the viewport, under the soft keyboard, and the send button becomes unreachable.

              `min-h-0` here would be the wrong repair. It would let this region shrink too — and
              since nothing inside it scrolls, it would clip the composer from the bottom instead of
              overflowing it, which is the same loss with a tidier edge. The region must keep its
              size; the fix is that its size must be BOUNDED. So every part of it that can grow is
              capped as a fraction of the viewport rather than at a constant: the agent statusline
              just below, and the draft field (`ui/chat/chat-input.tsx`, `min(10rem,30dvh)`). `dvh`
              already tracks the keyboard — the viewport meta is `interactive-widget=resizes-content`
              (hooks/use-keyboard.ts) — so the bound follows the real device instead of encoding one
              phone's pixels. `shrink-0` is what makes that bound the whole story. */}
          {/* …AND THE CHROME BELOW IT, the same way. The whole bottom region is ONE row of this
              column — the statusline, the grab handle, the status band and the composer are its
              parts, not its siblings — so zen takes it out as one row, through `Collapse`. Wrapping
              the region rather than each part is what keeps the parts' own relationships intact: the
              statusline is still the row immediately before the chrome block, and the handle is
              still the last thing before the composer, in zen and out of it. Tests read the ROW
              rather than the element for exactly this reason (agent-chat.test.tsx says so at the
              docking test). */}

                  so it is welded to the mirror's bottom edge and nothing may come between the two — it
                  was cut from the pane tail and it reads as the bottom of the screen it was cut from,
                  exactly as it did in the TUI. Verbatim text — React text nodes, so no XSS surface.

                  STACKED, one row per line, each truncated — deliberately, over the two alternatives:
                  joining the rows with a separator would put ~150 chars on a strip that fits ~55 at this
                  size on a phone, truncating away exactly the fields (branch, permission mode) this
                  exists to surface; wrapping makes the strip's height depend on the pane width and turns
                  a column-aligned statusline into ragged prose. Stacking also preserves the shape the
                  user themselves configured in the TUI, so it reads as the same thing they know.
                  THE UPSTREAM CAP IS A ROW COUNT, AND A ROW COUNT IS NOT A HEIGHT. `MAX_STATUS_LINES`
                  bounds what stripChrome will claim (8), which was read here as "bounded, nothing more
                  to do" — and that held only while the viewport was tall. With the soft keyboard up the
                  page is ~440px on a phone, so eight rows of `CTX:44% CACHE:100% LIMITS…` is a quarter
                  of everything on screen, held against a mirror that is already showing zero rows of
                  what the agent actually SAID. So there is a second cap now, and it is a fraction of
                  the viewport rather than a number of pixels: `max-h-[18dvh]`, which `dvh` keeps
                  honest on every device and through the keyboard. `overflow-y-auto` rather than
                  `overflow-hidden` so a row past the cap is scrolled to, never destroyed — this strip
                  carries the permission mode, and silently eating that row is worse than any height. */}

                  again the moment the agent added or dropped a row (the strip is 1–3 rows, re-derived
                  every poll). A control the thumb reaches for by muscle memory may not move because the
                  terminal printed something — DESIGN.md §2. Rendered here it is always the last thing
                  above the composer's status band, on every pane and in every state.

                  It also puts the statusline back where it belongs: that strip is the mirror's own last
                  row, cut from the pane tail, and a 34px gap with a grab handle in it read as a seam
                  between the terminal and a piece of chrome that IS the terminal. */}

                  terminal, a control with no ground. That is what "hard to distinguish" meant in dark,
                  where `--background` IS the mirror's fill (mirror-space.ts) and a 6px grip at
                  `bg-muted-foreground/50` was the only thing on screen saying a control was there.

                  §4). The composer keeps its own `bg-chrome` — the same value, so nothing changes
                  visually — which leaves it self-sufficient wherever it is mounted alone.

                  THE FILL IS `--chrome`, NOT `--muted`. Chrome is normally the page colour separated
                  by a rule, and this is the one place that rule cannot hold: the block sits on the
                  terminal mirror, and in dark `--background` IS the mirror's fill (mirror-space.ts).
                  It needs a fill. --muted was the wrong one — rgb(38) under a rgb(10) terminal, a
                  bright slab across the bottom of a dark screen, and the operator asked for it
                  darker. --chrome is rgb(23) in dark, the same raised surface the sheets stand on,
                  and unchanged at rgb(235) in light, where --card would be pure white and land
                  1.04:1 against the inverted mirror. index.css states the whole argument. */}

                    grip, it was py-3.5/34px until the 2026-08-31 shave; the drag is tracked from
                    the first pixel past useSheetPull's own slop, and the strip is full-width, so the
                    gesture still lands). Switching panes is a
                    BEFORE-typing act, so the row costs its height at the one moment it cannot be
                    wanted. Nothing is stranded: the tab strip above still switches, the sheet is still
                    reachable the instant the keyboard closes, and `Collapse` unmounts the button at
                    the end of the exit so it leaves the tab order with the pixels.

            sheet, and deliberately NOT inside the header slot that triggers it: the sheet is a
            plain `fixed inset-0` element with no portal (ui/sheet.tsx — "no Radix, no portals"), so
            it is positioned by the nearest transformed/filtered ancestor and stacks within the
            nearest stacking context. The header is `sticky z-20` and animates; a sheet mounted inside
            it would be laid out and z-ordered against the header rather than the viewport.

            FOCUS, for the find row specifically: the row calls `onClose()` and then `openFind()` in
            one React event, so a single commit unmounts the sheet and renders the FindBar into the
            header's `override`. React runs the unmounting tree's effect cleanups before the mounting
            tree's effects, so BottomSheet's focus-restore fires first — and it aims at the ⋮ button,
            which the override has just removed from the document, so it is a no-op on a detached
            node. FindBar's own mount effect then focuses the input and pops the keyboard. Verified in
            agent-chat.test.tsx rather than reasoned about, because the ordering is the whole
            argument. */}
