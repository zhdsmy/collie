// The ONE connection surface: a single, thin bar in the ribbon band under the header — `ui/strip-host.tsx`,
// registered from here as a StripSlot — that is the app's entire connection UI; the header pill is
// gone. It appears only on SUSTAINED trouble, escalates from amber → red on a real outage, flashes
// green on recovery, and otherwise renders nothing. It reads the SAME two shared-clock signals
// the header dog does (useConnectionTrouble at 4s, useConnectionLost at 15s), so bar and dog can never
// disagree; `connecting` is poll-truth (isConnecting) — navigator.onLine is COPY-only (it picks the
// red cause), never a gate. Threshold lockstep with the shared clock is proven in use-connection-lost;
// here we own the amber→red→green state machine and nothing else.
//
// ONE SLOT, THREE TONES, TWO RANKS. The tone changes inside the slot the way it always did, and the
// slot's PRIORITY moves with it: a lost connection is `OUTAGE`, trouble and the recovery flash are
// `DEGRADED` (`lib/strip-priority.ts`). Green is not a fifth level — it is this same fact, resolved,
// and it outranks the update offer for the second it stands for exactly the reason amber does.
//
// THREE OFFLINE STATES, TOLD APART HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE (M46 spec 10, reworded in pass 3):
//   1. The phone says it is offline (`navigator.onLine` false): "You are offline. Showing what was
//      saved at …".
//   2. Any other failed read: "No connection to the bridge. Showing what was saved at …", with a
//      smaller second line, "Check your connection or Tailscale."
//   3. The bridge answered and refused this device (a 403 `device not paired` or `device expired`
//      while a token was held): the wipe has run, nothing kept is drawn, and the pair screen is the
//      answer. No connection strip at all, below.
// The first two draw the saved copy and date it by when it was fetched.
//
// WHY STATE 2 GUESSES NO CAUSE. `navigator.onLine` false is a fact, so state 1 may say "offline". True
// is not the opposite fact: a VPN (Tailscale on a phone) keeps a network interface up, so the flag
// stays true in airplane mode. From inside the page, "the phone has no network" and "the bridge or the
// tunnel is down" then look the same: a request that gets no answer. Telling them apart would take a
// probe to some third-party host, and Collie does not make one (ADR 0034: Collie collects nothing).
// So the sentence says only what is known, and the second line names both places to look. It used to
// say "Is Tailscale connected?", which read as a diagnosis on a phone that was simply offline.
//
// WHEN IT APPEARS, AND WHY IT DOES NOT FLAP (M46 pass 3). The saved-copy strip is red at once when the
// screen IS the saved copy (`stale`), and the screen becomes that on the read that proves the outage
// (lib/connection-health.ts `noteNetworkFailure` and `noteServerFailure`: the first read that got no
// answer, the second one right after a wake, or the second 5xx in a row). It goes only on a live
// answer. Amber no longer stands in front
// of it: amber is kept for the one case where the bridge answers and says its multiplexer is down, so
// a failing read goes from nothing straight to the saved-copy strip, and a slow read (a stall) moves
// only the header dog. Every red variant reserves the height of the tallest one, so a change of
// sentence does not move the page.
