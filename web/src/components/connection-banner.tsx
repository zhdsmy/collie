// wrong more often than right. What the operator needs here is the one fact the old behaviour hid:
// this is not the network.
//
// Reload alone is NOT enough to reach a fronting proxy, which is what this banner used to claim. In
// an installed PWA the service worker answers every navigation it owns — a reload included — from
// the precached app shell, so a reload re-renders the same refused UI and never touches the proxy.
// "Sign in" is the escape: a real navigation to the one path the SW always passes to the network
// (lib/sw-routes). An <a>, not a button, so it is an ordinary navigation the SW sees as such — and
// so it still works if React is wedged. Reload stays alongside it, since a merely stale session on
// an already-signed-in device recovers without leaving the app.
