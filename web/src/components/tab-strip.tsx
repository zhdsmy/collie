// The selected space's tabs, drawn as TABS — the file-folder kind, not the pill kind.
//
// The two rows around this one (Spaces above, Panes below) are pills, and that difference is doing
// work: rows that navigate different dimensions should not look identical. A pill row says "pick one
// of these"; a folder tab says "this one is the drawer you are looking into", because the active tab
// is physically attached to the content beneath it.
//
// The illusion is three things, and all three have to be right or it reads as a button on a line:
//
//  1. A full-width baseline rule in --rule at the bottom of the row. It is the top edge of the
//     content region below, which is why it belongs to this row and not to that region.
//  2. The active tab is bordered on top/left/right in the SAME --rule, filled with the content
//     surface, and OPEN at the bottom — it covers the baseline for its own width, so the tab and
//     the content read as one continuous piece.
//  3. Inactive tabs are recessed: a quieter fill, muted text, and their box stops one pixel short,
//     so the baseline runs unbroken underneath them.
//
// The geometry that buys (2) is measured, not guessed, and the three numbers below are one set:
// the scroller is pulled one pixel down over the <nav>'s bottom border (`-mb-px`), carries one pixel
// of bottom padding so that pixel is INSIDE its clip box (`overflow-x` forces `overflow-y: auto`,
// so anything past the padding box is clipped away), and the active tab covers it with a 1px
// absolutely-positioned strip in the content colour. Change any one and the baseline shows through
// under the active tab, which is the whole thing.
//
// This row draws no name. The shape announces itself — that is the operator's reason for choosing
// it — so `LabelledStrip` is gone from here and the structure it provided lives inline: the <nav>,
// the accessible name (now an `aria-label`, since there is no visible word to point at), and the
// `-mx-4 px-4` that lets the last tab scroll clean off the screen while the first still starts on
// the route's 16px gutter. Spaces and Panes keep the primitive and keep their labels.
