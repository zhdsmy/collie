// The machine switcher. Structurally the SessionSwitcher's twin — same hidden-when-single predicate,
// same portalled sheet — and deliberately not its visual twin: two lookalike pills, one changing
// machines and one changing sessions on a machine, is a mis-tap into the wrong terminal (milestone
// constraint). This one is bordered and leads with a server glyph; the session pill is a filled muted
// capsule with layers.
//
// ── WHAT SELECTING A HOST DOES, AND WHAT IT DOESN'T ──────────────────────────
// It navigates HOME in that host (`?h=`), exactly as the session switcher does. It never tries to
// map the pane you are looking at onto the other machine: `w1:p1` there is a different terminal, and
// carrying the id across would be the single mistake this whole milestone exists to prevent.
//
// ── EVERY ROW NAVIGATES, INCLUDING AN UNREACHABLE ONE (M5/04) ────────────────
// These rows were disabled while their member was unreachable, and that was the wrong gate. §10.2's
// rule is that a down machine's last-good state NEVER VANISHES — it is still merged into the
// snapshot, still counted right here on the row ("1 needs you"), and still openable from triage,
// which is where a notification tap for that very agent lands. Blocking the SWITCHER alone made this
// the one surface that hid state the rest of the app shows, and it blocked LOOKING, which is not the
// dangerous verb. Writing is, and writing is gated where it happens: the composer is disabled behind
// `lib/host-health`'s `writable`, every write handler refuses first, and the HostStaleBanner says so
// before you reach either. A member that has never answered lands on an honest "nothing cached for
// this machine yet" rather than a spinner. So the row goes where it says it goes, and stays visually
// degraded to say what you will find there.
//
// ── AND WHAT IT IS NOT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Not pack administration. It lists members and lets you go to one; join / leave / promote / rotate
// are CLI verbs, and an unreachable row gets no "reconnect" button — the lead is already retrying on
// its own poll, and a button that only looks like it helps is worse than none.
// A module-level empty list, not a `= []` default in the parameter list: a fresh array literal on
// every render is a new reference, which defeats memoisation downstream for no benefit here.
