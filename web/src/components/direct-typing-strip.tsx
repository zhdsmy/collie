// The armed indicator for direct typing, in the same in-flow slot as the "You sent:" strip.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS ON TOP OF THE RESTYLED BUTTON AND TEXTAREA. Those two are exactly the elements a
// user stops looking at once they start typing, so they fail the glance-back test: come back to the
// phone twenty seconds later and nothing in your field of view says the next keystroke goes straight
// into a running agent. This strip sits where the eye already goes for composer state, cannot scroll
// away, and says what is happening in words.
//
// WHEN THIS REACHES THE PACK BRANCH IT MUST NAME THE HOST. On v1 every write surface carries a
// HostChip, because a write names its target; a mode that streams keystrokes into a terminal without
// saying WHICH machine would be the one write path that doesn't. That component does not exist on
// main, so the chip goes in at the merge, next to the label below.
