// WHY THIS EXISTS ON TOP OF THE RESTYLED BUTTON AND TEXTAREA. Those two are exactly the elements a
// user stops looking at once they start typing, so they fail the glance-back test: come back to the
// phone twenty seconds later and nothing in your field of view says the next keystroke goes straight
// into a running agent. This strip sits where the eye already goes for composer state, cannot scroll
// away, and says what is happening in words.
//
// WHEN THIS REACHES THE CREW BRANCH IT MUST NAME THE HOST. On v1 every write surface carries a
// HostChip, because a write names its target; a mode that streams keystrokes into a terminal without
// saying WHICH machine would be the one write path that doesn't. That component does not exist on
// main, so the chip goes in at the merge, next to the label below.
//
// WITH A DRAFT IN THE BOX, the hint says it is kept instead. Arming hides the draft rather than
// refusing it, and a draft that vanished without a word would read as lost.
