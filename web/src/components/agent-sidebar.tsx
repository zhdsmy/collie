// any bare shell panes under a trailing "Shells" group, with the open one highlighted. Switching is
// the ONLY action here — closing a pane lives in the pane pill's long-press sheet (with its own
// confirm), so a fat-thumbed switch can never destroy a pane.
//
// This sheet sees the WHOLE herd, so it has the same problem the dashboard had: the two long tails
// (Recent, and 30-odd bare shells) bury the handful of agents you actually came to switch to. Both
// fold, and both remember it, using the dashboard's own header primitive.
// A module-level empty list, not a `= []` default in the parameter list: a fresh array literal on
// every render is a new reference, which defeats memoisation downstream for no benefit here.
