// action here — closing a pane lives in the pane pill's long-press sheet (with its own confirm), so a
// fat-thumbed switch can never destroy a pane.
//
// NOTHING HERE MOVES WHEN A PANE CHANGES STATE (ADR 0063). This sheet used to sort into the triage
// sections (Needs you, Ready, Working, Recent), so a row changed section, and therefore place, every
// time its agent took a turn: the row the thumb was reaching for was elsewhere by the time it landed,
// and on this sheet a wrong tap opens another terminal. Urgency is a MARK now, exactly as on the
// dashboard: the row's alarm edge, the lit heading, and one summary line on top that counts what
// needs you and jumps to the first of it.
//
// THE ORDER IS THE OPERATOR'S, AND IT STILL DOES NOT MOVE (ADR 0071). Place order is the default and
// is unchanged. Activity and Cache are the alternatives ADR 0063's closing clause allows, "a toggle
// the operator taps and watches": each reads the clock once, when the sheet opens, and holds that
// reading until the operator taps again. So the sentence above survives the new settings rather than
// being weakened by them. A pane that finishes a turn while the sheet is up still repaints where it
// stands, and so does one whose cache window ticks down under the reader's thumb.
//
// The two long tails still fold: 30-odd bare shells, and the Launch rows, using the dashboard's own
// header primitive and remembering it. In either ranked order the sections and the Shells fold give
// way to one list, for the reason at `rankedRows`.
//
// This device's pinned panes lead the sheet in a Pinned section (ADR 0070), in the dashboard's place
// order, each listed once. The sheet stays switch-only: pinning lives in the pane menu.
// A module-level empty list, not a `= []` default in the parameter list: a fresh array literal on
// every render is a new reference, which defeats memoisation downstream for no benefit here.

  // the thumb misses, and on THIS sheet a missed tap opens another terminal. Its closing clause
  // leaves one door open: an order the operator asks for and watches. ADR 0071 walks through it.
  //
  // So activity order reads the clock ONCE, when the sheet opens, and draws from that reading until
  // the operator taps the toggle. A pane that finishes a turn while the sheet is up repaints where
  // it stands; it does not climb past the row a thumb is already reaching for. The sheet unmounts on
  // close (ui/sheet.tsx returns null), so the next open is a fresh reading by construction, and the
  // one thing that re-reads while it is open is the operator's own tap.
  //
  // The reading itself lives in `hooks/use-frozen-ranks.ts`, shared with the dashboard, so the two
  // surfaces keep the one promise the one way. A tap on the toggle, the segment already selected
  // included, asks for a new reading; nothing else does.
