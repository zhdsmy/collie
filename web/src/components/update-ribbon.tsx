// ── THE UPDATE BAND ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ONE top-of-app row for the whole update subject: a release is available, the confirm was just
// tapped, a run is in flight, the bridge is new and this bundle is behind it, and peers are
// following. It sits in the slot `UpdateAvailableBanner` used to occupy in `routes/root.tsx`, which
// it absorbs entirely — there is no second top band for updates.
//
// ── IN-FLOW, NEVER OVER THE HEADER ───────────────────────────────────────────
// A shrink-0 flex row in RootLayout's column. The shell consumes the top inset; standalone use
// retains the env() fallback. It
// RESERVES space rather than overlaying, which is the whole reason a banner here can never cover a
// route's sticky header. No `fixed`, no `absolute`, no z-index escape — asserted by a test.
//
// ── FIXED HEIGHT, IN EVERY STATE ─────────────────────────────────────────────
// The row is one height whatever it is saying, and only the text changes. A band that grew and
// shrank as a run progressed would reflow the whole route under the operator's thumb mid-update,
// which is the one moment they are least able to tolerate it. Hence an explicit height rather than
// vertical padding, and one truncating line rather than a wrapping paragraph. The strings are held
// to a 40-character budget in all six locales for the same reason (see the i18n test).
//
// ── MOUNTED UNCONDITIONALLY ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `useSelfUpdate()` is a CONTROLLER as well as a flag: it drives the bundle auto-reload for the
// app's lifetime, and it only runs while something mounts it. So this component mounts always and
// returns null when it has nothing to say — exactly the invariant the banner it replaces carried.
//
// ── A DISMISSAL IS THE MACHINE'S, NOT THE BROWSER'S ──────────────────────────
// Closing the band posts the version to the bridge, which keeps it beside the digest's own record
// (M17/08). One tap on the phone therefore drops the band on the laptop at its next poll, and the
// same request stops tomorrow's digest naming the version that was just declined. The local state
// below is optimistic only — it drops the band on the tap instead of on the poll.
//
// ── THE BAND NEVER STARTS AN UPDATE ──────────────────────────────────────────
// Four of the five states navigate to `/settings/updates`, where the confirm lives. A band that
// could start an update from any screen would be the reflex tap the confirm was designed against.
// The one exception taps `checkForUpdate()`, which reloads THIS PAGE onto a bundle that is already
// built — it changes nothing on the host.
