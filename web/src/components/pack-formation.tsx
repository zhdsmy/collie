// The pack census drawn as a FORMATION rather than listed as rows.
//
// ── WHY A PICTURE AND NOT A LIST ─────────────────────────────────────────────
// A list answers "how is each machine", which the sheet still does. The question a list could never
// answer at a glance is the one that decides what the operator does next: WHO STANDS WHERE. Lead at
// the apex, deputy directly beneath it on a thick connector, everyone else fanned in a V on thin
// ones — so "there is no deputy" is a missing row you cannot fail to notice, and a pack whose peers
// have all gone grey reads as a shape before it reads as words.
//
// ── IT IS ONE INLINE <svg>, AND THAT IS A CONSTRAINT, NOT A SHORTCUT ─────────
// No chart library, no new dependency: the drawing is eleven circles and some cubics, and a library
// would arrive with its own colour system that this app would then have to fight. Every colour here
// is a THEME TOKEN carried by `currentColor` through a Tailwind `text-*` class, so light/dark and
// the contrast work recorded in index.css apply unchanged.
//
// ── THE RING'S HUE IS THE APP'S OWN STATUS VOCABULARY, NOT A NEW ONE ─────────
// A healthy machine is GREEN (`status-done`), and it may not be amber: `status-working` is this
// app's "needs attention" signal (index.css says so where the token is defined), and spending it on
// the state that needs nothing would make every well-behaved pack look like it wanted something. So
// the ladder is the one the rest of Collie already speaks — green = fine, amber = look at this,
// red = go fix this, grey = we have nothing to tell you — and STALE is what earns the amber, because
// a receipt going old is precisely the case that wants a glance.
//
// ── AND COLOUR IS NEVER THE ONLY ENCODING ────────────────────────────────────
// Amber-vs-green and amber-vs-red are both hard pairs for a red-green colour-blind reader, and the
// grey of "we have never heard from it" is a hair from the grey of anything else. So the ring
// carries a DASH PATTERN as well as a hue (solid = fine, dashed = stale, dotted = never seen), every
// node is captioned with its own name, and the health WORD rides in the node's `aria-label` and
// again in the sheet. Nothing on this page is knowable by hue alone.
//
// ── THE GEOMETRY IS A PURE FUNCTION ──────────────────────────────────────────
// {@link formationLayout} takes members and a deputy id and returns coordinates. It renders nothing
// and reads no clock, so the shape of a 1-, 2-, 3- and 7-machine pack is unit-testable without a
// DOM — which is the only practical way to pin a layout that is otherwise judged by eye.
