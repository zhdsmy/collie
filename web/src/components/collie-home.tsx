// The single, shared Collie mark: brand + home button + connection loader in one, so the top-left of
// every screen means the same thing. ONE element in all three states — <CollieMark/>, which is a
// still drawing while live, starts turning (the "bloom") once the connection has been not-live for a
// sustained beat (`trouble`), and goes still again, muted, once the outage escalates (`lost`). That
// is why this no longer swaps a sprite for a still image: the old sprite had no rest frame (frame 0
// is a full-stretch mid-stride pose that reads as frozen mid-run), so rest had to be a different
// picture. This mark rests by not animating at all, so nothing is ever swapped and nothing can
// resize as the connection settles.
// The mark is now the app's ONLY animal: the boot splash and the idle cover bloom this same mark, so
// "Collie is fetching" looks the same wherever it appears. <DogGallop/> is untouched but no longer
// mounted anywhere in the app (see components/dog-gallop.tsx).
//
// Tapping it returns to the dashboard, and the MARK IS THE WHOLE BUTTON. The brand word used to sit
// inside it on the dashboard; it moved out when the header's identity became two stacked lines —
// "Collie" over "on <mux>" — because the mux line has always had to stay OUTSIDE this button (the
// aria-label below would replace it for a screen reader) and the two lines cannot be stacked beside
// the mark with one of them trapped in here. See app-header.tsx, which now owns both lines. What is
// left is exactly the 44px tap box DESIGN.md §6 asks for, and every header renders THIS component —
// the consistency is structural, not a convention two files have to keep agreeing on.
// One full round of the orbit at the mark's LOADING rate, in milliseconds. <CollieMark/> owns that
// rate (`TURN.live`, collie-mark.tsx) and does not export it, so this number is a copy and has to
// stay in step with it: shorter cuts the round off part way, longer starts a second one. The rate
// is set in the collie-brand repo (`SPRINT` in src/geometry.ts) — a change there has to be walked
// over to here by hand, and this is the only thing on this side that knows the number.

/**
 * The round's SHAPE, as a multiplier on the mark's own live rate: a raised cosine on a WARPED clock.
 *
 * The round used to be a square wave — the orbit went from its 48s drift to its 1.8s sprint in one
 * frame, held, and dropped back just as hard. That reads as a film starting, not as a thing being
 * spun. The operator asked for it to "behave kinda as if a human spun a wheel", which is a statement
 * about the DERIVATIVE: a wheel leaves your hand accelerating and comes back to rest slowing down.
 *
 * A raised cosine `1 − cos(2πθ)` gave that, and it is still the curve underneath. What it got wrong
 * is that it is SYMMETRIC: it decelerates exactly as hard as it accelerates, and a thrown wheel does
 * not. The hand is on it for a moment and gone; friction then takes it down over a long tail. The
 * operator's follow-up — "the slowdown can be even smoother" — is that asymmetry, named.
 *
 * ── THE WARP, AND WHY IT COSTS NOTHING ───────────────────────────────────────
 * The fix is not a different curve, it is the same curve on a clock that does not run evenly:
 *
 *     rate(θ) = (1 − cos(2π·u(θ))) · u′(θ)      u(θ) = θ + s·θ(1−θ)      s = {@link SPIN_SKEW}
 *
 * `u` is a smooth increasing bijection of [0,1] onto itself, so this is a substitution — and by the
 * substitution rule ∫₀¹ (1−cos 2πu) u′ dθ = ∫₀¹ (1−cos 2πu) du = 1, **for ANY such `u`**. That is
 * the whole reason the warp is expressed this way rather than by hand-shaping a tail: the mean is 1
 * BY CONSTRUCTION, not by a constant somebody re-derived. Skew it further, or swap `u` entirely, and
 * the round still covers exactly one turn in exactly `ORBIT_TURN_MS` — which is the property
 * everything else rests on (shorter cuts the turn off part way, longer starts a second one).
 *
 * Every property the symmetric version was chosen for survives the warp, and two improve:
 *
 *   • `rate(0) = rate(T) = 0` — both factors' zeros are at the ends of `u`, and `u′` never vanishes,
 *     so the standstill at each join is untouched by any `s`.
 *   • `rate′(0) = rate′(T) = 0` — likewise. No velocity step at either join, same as before.
 *   • **mean exactly 1**, as above. Unchanged, and now structural rather than incidental.
 *   • **the stop is 8× less abrupt.** `rate″(T) = 4π²(1−s)³`, so at s = 0.5 the curvature the round
 *     ends on is an eighth of the symmetric curve's. Measured on the rate itself: 90% of the way
 *     through, the orbit is at 0.036 of the sprint rather than 0.191 — a five-fold gentler tail.
 *   • **the throw is sharper**, which is the same fact: `rate″(0) = 4π²(1+s)³`, 3.4× steeper. The
 *     turn is conserved, so a longer coast has to be paid for by a quicker throw. That is not a
 *     side effect to apologise for — it is what a hand does.
 *
 * The peak moves with it: 2.27 at 35% of the round, rather than 2.00 at 50%. So the deceleration now
 * owns 65% of the round and the acceleration 35%.
 *
 * Pure, exported and tested, because it is the only half of this that can be checked without eyes.
 */

/**
 * How far the clock is warped, in [0,1). `0` is the plain symmetric raised cosine this replaced, so
 * the change is a strict generalisation and the old behaviour is one constant away.
 *
 * It may not reach 1: `u′(θ) = 1 + s(1−2θ)` falls to `1 − s` at the end of the round, so at s = 1
 * the clock stops dead and the tail is infinitely long; past it `u′` goes negative and the orbit
 * would run BACKWARDS through the last of the round. 0.5 is half the available skew and the number

  // ONE FULL ROUND OF THE ORBIT whenever the app publishes a status — a send landing, an agent
  // finishing somewhere in the herd, a refusal, the pane closing under you.
  //
  // UNATTENDED-ONLY WAS BUILT AND REVERTED, and the argument is worth keeping because it is a good
  // argument that lost to the operator's own eye. It ran: a tap is already answered where the tap
  // happened — a ✓ on the send button, a spinner on the option, the draft leaving the box — and the
  // eye that would read the mark is on the thumb at the bottom of the screen, not on the header at
  // the top; so spend the round only on things that arrive from elsewhere, where nothing else can
  // fetch the eye. A `lib/status.ts` flag carried that distinction and four call sites set it.
  //
  // The operator used it and asked for the round back on their own sends. Reported plainly: the send
  // is the moment they look UP, because the reply is what they are waiting for — the thumb leaves
  // the box and the whole screen becomes the thing being watched. The theory put the eye where the
  // last touch was; in use it goes where the next change will be. The flag is gone rather than left
  // unread: a boolean nothing branches on is a lie the next reader has to disprove.
  //
  // So the rule is the simple one, and `lib/status.ts` is its whole definition: if it was worth a
  // notice, it is worth a round. That also keeps the two from ever disagreeing about what happened.
  //
  // It is the ORBIT that turns, not the mark. The whole SVG was rotated first and that was wrong:
  // the head span round with it, which is not a thing the drawing does. So this uses the mark's own
  // `loading` input instead — the same beads on the same path, at 27x the resting drift. The mark
  // carries the phase across the rate change by hand (collie-mark.tsx says how), so the round joins
  // the drift where it left it and rejoins it where it lands. Nothing jumps at either end.
  //
  // The accents come up to full chroma for the round as well. That is the mark's own coupling, not
  // an extra: under `prefers-reduced-motion` the turning stops and the colour is the only thing
  // left saying anything happened.
  //
  // It never fights the connection state. `bloom` is already the loading input and outranks this —
  // a round would tell the reader nothing there — and while `lost` the mark stays still and muted,
  // which is a state a passing event must not overwrite.
  //
  // ONE round per burst, not one per status. A single action often publishes more than one, and a
  // herd finishing together publishes several within a poll; each one restarting the timer would run
  // the orbit on and on, which is a STATE again and the exact thing the round must not look like. A
  // status that lands while a round is already turning is dropped: the round it would have started
  // is already on screen, saying the same thing.
  // ── THE THIRD LOADING INPUT: work the operator started and is waiting on ─────────────────────
  //
  // A round is an EVENT (something happened, once). The bloom is a CONNECTION STATE. This is the
  // third kind and it was missing: a job with a real duration — a send in flight, an image
  // uploading, a clip being transcribed, a route waiting on its loader — where the honest thing to
  // show is "still going", starting when it starts and stopping when it stops. lib/busy.ts owns the
  // counter and states what feeds it and, more importantly, what deliberately does not: the 1.5s
  // background poll is excluded, because an orbit fed from it would never come to rest and a mark
  // that always spins says nothing at all. Hung polls stay the stall detector's job — that is
  // `trouble` below, which is already wired.
  //
  // It joins `bloom` as a loading input rather than replacing it, and it does NOT outrank `lost`:
  // while the connection is given up on, the mark stays still and muted (see `lost` on the props),
  // and a send the operator fires into a dead link must not make it look like the app is trying
  // again. Same guard the round already carries, for the same reason.
  //
  // No debounce, and none is wanted: <CollieMark/> carries the orbit's phase across the rate change
  // by hand (collie-mark.tsx), so a 200ms spin joins the drift where it left it and rejoins it where
  // it lands. Short work reads as a brief accelerate/decelerate, never as a flicker — which is what
  // lets the spin last exactly as long as the work and not one frame more.

  // ── THE THROW: the round's rate is ramped, not switched ──────────────────────
  //
  // Everything above decides WHETHER the orbit turns. This decides HOW. `spinRate` is the curve and
  // states why it is that curve; this is the machinery that applies it, and there are three reasons
  // it is done HERE, in JavaScript, rather than as an easing in the stylesheet.
  //
  //  1. **The stylesheet is not ours to edit.** components/collie-mark.tsx is GENERATED and
  //     hash-sealed — a test recomputes the digest and fails on any hand-edit; changes belong in the
  //     collie-brand repo's scripts/logo-ship.ts. The `linear` on the bead animations is emitted
  //     there.
  //  2. **An `animation-timing-function` would tear the mark in two.** Each bead runs TWO animations
  //     off one clock: `cm-tN` moves it, and `cm-nN`/`cm-fN` are `step-end` switches that swap it
  //     between the near group (drawn over the head, with a knockout) and the far group. Easing the
  //     first and not the second makes the bead cross in front of the head at the wrong angle. They
  //     have to stay on ONE timeline, which is exactly what a playback rate is and a timing function
  //     is not.
  //  3. **It would fight the phase carry.** collie-mark.tsx hand-corrects every animation's
  //     `currentTime` across a rate change, because a running CSS animation keeps its elapsed time
  //     and not its progress. That correction preserves the FRACTION, and under a non-linear timing
  //     function the fraction and the rendered position stop being the same thing — so the round
  //     would begin and end with the beads jumping up to ~35°, which is the exact glitch that code
  //     exists to prevent. `updatePlaybackRate` has no such problem: it is specified to hold the
  //     current time and change only the rate from here on, so progress and time stay identified and
  //     the `step-end` switches keep landing where the beads actually are.
  //
  // It costs one `requestAnimationFrame` loop for 1.8 seconds per round and nothing at all between
  // rounds. That is not the "never per frame" the mark's own phase-carry comment rules out — that
  // rule is about the RESTING mark, where a per-frame cost would be permanent.
  //
  // ONLY THE ROUND IS RAMPED, never the bloom. `bloom` is a sustained connection state and must turn
  // steadily; a wheel-throw there would read as an event that keeps happening. So the ramp is
  // declined whenever the bloom is what is driving the mark, and the round below still runs — it is
  // simply invisible under a bloom that is already turning, which was already true.

          floated on the bar. This mark carries its own ring — the orbit IS the frame — and a
          40px circle with `overflow-hidden` would clip the beads that pass widest.

          The DRAWING is 40px; the BOX around it is `size-11` (44px), the same tap floor every other
          icon control in the header carries (SettingsGear, the Settings/Crew back button). This is a
          real button — it navigates home — so 40px was simply under the target, and it was also what
          made the header row 4px shorter inside a pane, where no 44px gear was there to set the
          height. The row now states its own floor (`min-h-15` in app-header.tsx), so this box no longer
          SIZES the header; it just stops being the short child. Keep the two numbers apart: 40 is the
          mark, 44 is the touchable box it is centred in.

          `paper` is the header's own ground, which is `bg-background` (app-header.tsx — chrome is
          the page colour, separated by a rule, not a fill). It is the colour of the knockout that
          makes a near-side bead read as being IN FRONT of the head; anything else shows up as a
          halo around those beads, so this value tracks the ground and is not a taste choice. The
          two are COUPLED and the coupling is easy to forget, so app-header.test.tsx fails if the
          header's background utility and this prop ever name different tokens.
