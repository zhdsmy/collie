          → 245 (mirror) in the 120px where --background's 0.97 was picked precisely to close the seam
          against the inverted mirror. The band only existed because `border-border/60` measures 1.09:1
          on the page and could not carry the separation alone; `border-rule` is 1.34:1 light / 2.06:1
          dark and can. COUPLED: CollieHome's `paper` is the knockout colour and must name this same
          background or every near-side bead grows a halo — app-header.test.tsx asserts the two agree.

              icon control in here is built to + this row's own `py-2`. Before it, the row simply took
              the height of the tallest thing a caller happened to pass, so the header was 60px on the
              dashboard (the 44px SettingsGear) and 56px inside a pane (no gear, so the 40px mark was
              tallest) — a 4px jump on every dashboard→pane navigation. A row whose height is decided by
              its props cannot be stable, so the floor is stated here, once, and no caller can lower it.
              `min-h` rather than `h`: a future child taller than 44px still GROWS the row instead of
              being clipped or overflowing it — the header would get taller (on every route at once,
              because they all mount this row), which is a visible design decision rather than a silent
              overlap.

              `py-1`, not `py-2` — and the 4px it gives back is not a saving, it is a RELOCATION. The
              pane's identity block is three lines now (caption / name / cwd), and with 8px of outer
              padding it had one leftover pixel to divide between them: measured, 8px above the block
              against a 1px gap between its lines, an 8 : 1 ratio where the two-line block had been 5 : 1.
              The line count rose 50% and the air between the lines halved, which is why fewer items did
              not produce a calmer row — it reads as one grey paragraph rather than three lines. At `py-1`
              the content box is 52px and the block spends it 12 / 4 / 20 / 4 / 12, so outer air and inner
              air are both 4px and the row still measures exactly 60px on every route. Nothing moves and
              nothing is clipped. What it gives up is the 8px of breathing room a future taller-than-44px
              child would have got; it gets 4.

              SINCE THEN the pane's block lost its caption line — the status word moved down to the
              composer's status strip — so it is TWO lines and 36px, not three and 52px. `py-1` is
              therefore no longer load-bearing here: 36px of lines centred inside a 60px floor leaves
              12px of air above and below whether this padding is 4px or 8px, measured both ways. So
              `py-2` would now read identically and would hand a future taller-than-44px child its 8px
              back. That is a PROPOSAL, not a change — the number is left exactly where it was measured,
              one variable at a time. */}

                    beside the mark. It was ONE 18px line — "Collie on <mux>" — and on a phone that
                    line ran out of room inside the multiplexer's NAME, the one word here the reader
                    does not already know; the operator's screenshot had it down to a single letter.
                    Stacking inverts what gives way. The two runs no longer compete for one line's
                    width, so the brand costs the name nothing and the name gets the whole block —
                    the width this block asks the row for is the mux line's alone (the brand is out
                    of flow, see below). Both lines still carry `truncate`, and the brand is the one
                    that clips first, because it is the shorter run inside a box the longer run
                    sized.

                    The brand wears the app's EXISTING 11px uppercase tracked tier — `SectionLabel`,
                    DESIGN.md §1 — and not a new type style. It reads as the eyebrow over the line
                    that carries the information, which is the right emphasis: which multiplexer is
                    under this collie is what a support question needs; that the app is called Collie
                    is not.

                    THE MUX LINE IS THE BLOCK'S ONLY FLOW CHILD; the brand rides above it out of
                    flow. This is what puts "on <mux>" on the same visual line as the row's other
                    centred children (the host/session chips, the gear): the row centres every
                    child, so whatever height this block CONTRIBUTES is what gets centred — and
                    when it contributed both lines (40.5px), the mux line's centre landed 8px below
                    everything else's, which read as the right cluster floating on its own line
                    between the two left ones. With the eyebrow absolute (`bottom-full`), the block
                    contributes exactly the mux line's 24px box, so that line's centre IS the row's
                    centre, shared with every chip. The alignment holds by construction, not by a
                    compensating offset that would drift the next time a size changes.

                    THE ROW'S HEIGHT STILL DOES NOT MOVE (DESIGN.md §2, §6). The row is `min-h-15`
                    (60px) with `py-1`, a 52px content box, and its tallest child is the mark's 44px
                    tap box — this block now contributes 24px, less than before, so nothing grows.
                    The eyebrow is 11px at `leading-none` (the arbitrary size would otherwise take
                    the body's 1.5 and draw 16.5px): from the block's top at 18px it reaches up to
                    7px from the row's top edge, inside the row's own box with the top padding to
                    spare. An out-of-flow child adds no width either — this block is sized by the
                    mux line alone, which the old flex column already guaranteed in practice (the
                    brand is the shorter run) and this makes true by construction; `max-w-full`
                    keeps the eyebrow clipping to that width, so it still truncates first. The mux
                    logo changes none of it: 1.15em on a -0.2em baseline shift stays inside the
                    line box the type already asked for.

                    It rides WITH the wordmark claim (dashboard + space, never the pane, where the
                    breadcrumb owns the width) and sits OUTSIDE the home button, as the mux line
                    always has: that button's aria-label would otherwise replace both lines for a
                    screen reader. The brand word moved out of the button with it, so the tap target
                    is the mark's own 44px box and nothing else — the floor §6 asks for, and the same
                    box the gear at the other end of the row has. */}

                              bytes come from an adapter, and the one way to be certain adapter-
                              supplied markup can never become document markup is to never put it in
                              the document (the mirror's XSS boundary, same rule). The bridge serves
                              it sandboxed. Sized in `em` so it tracks this line's own type rather
                              than a pixel guess, and inline so the line stays ONE text run — the
                              sentence is still "on <name>" to a screen reader and to a text query.
                              Nothing renders when the bridge published no URL. */}

 * WHY A PORTAL, and not a context the route writes its nodes into. The nodes are the point: the
 * pane's breadcrumb closes over `openSpace`, the find bar over `setFindQuery` and the match cursor.
 * Pushing live nodes through state means writing them in an effect, which is one render LATE by
 * construction (the header paints the previous route's items for a frame, or none), and re-writing
 * them on every route render, which is a fresh object every time and therefore either a render loop
 * or a hand-rolled external store. A portal has neither problem: the children are rendered by the
 * ROUTE, in the same commit as the route, so the header's contents are exactly as fresh as the
 * screen under it and there is no extra render pass at all.
 *
 * It also keeps the right things resetting. Everything a route puts in the row still LIVES in the
 * route's tree, so the find bar's query, the switchers' open sheets and the pane's identity all
 * still unmount with their route, exactly as before. The hoist deliberately preserves only what the
 * shell owns — the mark, the strip, the rule, the height — and every one of those is global by
 * nature. A stateful hoisted header would have carried one screen's find bar into the next screen.
 *
 * TWO ROUTES DURING A TRANSITION. React commits the leaving route's teardown before the arriving
 * route's layout effects, so the ordinary sequence is release → claim and the arriving route wins.
 * `owner` in the shell makes the reverse order harmless too. And because the claim is four
 * primitives, `setClaim` bails out when nothing actually changed, so a route re-rendering on every
 * poll does not re-render the header — which is the whole point of not remounting it.
