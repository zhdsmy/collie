/**
 * How long a chip or a link may be and still refuse to break at all.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS A NUMBER AND NOT A CSS PROPERTY ──────────────────────────────
 * A hyphen and a slash are ORDINARY wrap opportunities. No `overflow-wrap` setting changes that,
 * and `word-break: keep-all` does not either (measured in Chromium, 2026-09-30: it suppresses
 * nothing in Latin text). So `--force` broke as `--` / `force` and `readme-herdr-client` broke
 * after either hyphen, whenever one happened to land near the right edge. The only property that
 * forbids those breaks is `white-space: nowrap`, and that one forbids the break we DO want: a 78
 * character path under it ran 312px past the column, off the side of a phone.
 *
 * So the renderer decides, because it is the one thing here that can see the text. Short enough to
 * fit a line of its own: never break it. Longer than that: break anywhere, since it has to break
 * somewhere.
 *
 * ── AND WHY 24 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Measured against the built stylesheet at this face and size: the first chip to overrun a column
 * is 36 characters at 280px, 42 at 320px and 44 at 340px. 280px is about as narrow as this prose
 * ever gets (a 320px phone, less the stream's padding and a list's indent), so 24 keeps a third of
 * that narrowest measure in hand for a device whose OS font scale is turned up. It covers what
 * agents actually write in backticks: a flag, a short sha, a file name, a branch, `origin/main`.
