// The Typeface card — the APP's own face, per device.
//
// This setting exists because the one that used to be here didn't. The face was the maker's choice
// and the code said so in two places ("round-4 F-D1"); the maker asked for the setting, and ADR 0033
// records what fell and what replaced it. What SURVIVED is the other half of that rule and it is
// still absolute: the chosen face dresses chrome and never an agent's words. Nothing here touches
// --font-mono or --font-content, and nothing here may learn to.
//
// IT SITS DIRECTLY ABOVE THE TERMINAL FONT CARD, and there is deliberately NO section heading over
// the pair. Settings is a flat stack of cards; a labelled "Design" group would be the first heading
// on the page and would imply four more. Two adjacent cards, one named for the app's face and one
// named for the terminal's, say the same thing with less furniture — and the ADJACENCY is the point,
// because "which font does this change" is the only question either card raises.
//
// A NATIVE <select>, for exactly the reasons LanguageControl and the terminal family picker give:
// this is a set-once preference, stacked radios would make it the tallest card on the page, and the
// platform's own picker is better than one we could draw.
//
// FAMILY NAMES ARE PROPER NOUNS and are not translated. The NOTE under the select is a phrase about
// a face rather than the name of one, so it goes through the dictionary like every other sentence.
