/**
 * The status as a WORD, in the caption register — the pane header's line 1, where the state rides
 * with the identity instead of competing with the actions for the name's width.
 *
 * Why a word at all, when the header already carries a dot: a 10px disc encodes this range in HUE
 * ALONE, and the range does not survive it. Simulated on the app's own `--status-*` tokens, a
 * deuteranope reads blocked, working and done as ONE colour in light theme (OKLab ΔE 0.014–0.046
 * against a ~0.05 floor at this size), and "needs you" against "done" — the app's most consequential
 * opposite pair — collapses in BOTH themes. Idle and unknown are 0.02 apart in lightness and are the
 * same dot for everybody. The dot is the anchor and welds the state to its subject; the word is the
 * statement for every reader the colour fails. Both, not either.
 *
 * Coloured with the same `--status-*` tokens as the chip's TEXT, not as its fill — those values are
 * tuned for text contrast on this ground, which is exactly the job here. No alpha modifier: index.css
 * says outright that no token value rescues a `/70`.
 *
 * THE COMPOSER NO LONGER DRAWS IT, and nothing else in the app does either — the 14px status band
 * above the actions row was its one call site, and Altan asked for that half of the band to go
 * ("the status is unnecessary at this place"). It is kept as the catalog entry for this idea, and
 * the measurement above is kept with it, because the measurement is what justifies the one NAMED
 * `StatusDot` in the app: the pane header's badge carries `label={statusLabel(...)}` precisely so a
 * reader the colour fails still gets the range, now that no word says it. `StatusWordSlot`, the
 * reserved-width form this had for standing beside the host, left with the band.
