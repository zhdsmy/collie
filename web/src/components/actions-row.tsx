// ONE ROW OF ACTIONS, DIRECTLY ABOVE THE INPUT. Collie's own controls first — Keys, Type, Quick,
// Agent, the display gear — then the running harness's own commands in a section of their own. It
// scrolls sideways; nothing wraps and nothing is dropped.
//
// IT IS A BELT: ONE FULL-BLEED BAND, NOT TWO FLOATING CAPSULES. The row is a continuous strip that
// runs edge to edge, closed above and below by a hairline, with a quiet ground of its own. Collie's
// controls stand DIRECTLY on that ground with no outline at all; the harness's commands stand in a
// SECTION of the same band — a square-cornered rectangle spanning the belt's full inner height,
// tinted with the harness's brand. One belt, two parts, and the tint boundary is what separates
// them. There is no divider and no thick left border: a rule between two groups in one scroller is a
// line the eye steps over on every pan, and a thick left border is a house rule we do not break.
//
// It is here because Altan tested the two-capsule row on his phone and asked for "a ribbon or belt
// like visual for this menu". The capsules read as two objects dropped onto the chrome; the belt
// reads as one strip with two parts, which is what the row actually is. Nothing about the behaviour
// changed — only how the row is drawn.
//
// THE GROUND IS PLAIN CHROME AGAIN — DESIGN.md §4 RESTORED (operator's call, 2026-09-16). For a
// day the belt carried its own fill (`bg-foreground/6`, the one symmetric wash against `--chrome` —
// `--muted` IS `--chrome` in light, `--card` in dark) and the scroller a brand tint
// (`bg-primary/10`); both were measured picks of 2026-09-14, recorded in git history. The operator
// read the band against the composer row under it and asked for the keys' ground "same as the
// others", so the belt sits on the composer's own chrome and the HAIRLINE below is the only
// separation — which is what §4 says chrome does. The rules did not move: `border-b border-border`.
//
// THE HAIRLINE IS `--border`, NOT `--rule`. The belt's lower neighbour is the same chrome surface it
// stands on, so that is a component edge inside one surface, which is what `--border` is for — the
// same reading the status band above it came to. `border-b` alone: the belt stands flush under the
// mirror and the chrome block's own `border-t border-rule` is the boundary up there, so a second
// rule here would be two lines where the language says one. No rounded ends anywhere either: a belt
// with rounded corners is a capsule again.
//
// It replaced two separate rows. The Controls row and the harness bar sat one above the other, each
// spending a row of a phone's glass on four or five buttons, and the operator read them as one thing
// anyway: "what can I press from here". Merged, the composer gets a row back and the harness
// commands sit at the same height as the keys they were always meant to live beside.
//
// THE BELT'S PINNED END IS THE SWITCH MARK (the right end; the left under `hand="left"`, see {@link Hand}),
// AND THE MACHINE IS NOT HERE ANY MORE. The write host was pinned at that end for a day. Altan's verdict on the phone, once the pull-up chevron had shipped
// on the rule: the chevron "is now blocking the Quick action, it's a bad spot". So the chevron went,
// the pinned slot became the switcher's own control — a real target, at the pill register, above the
// send button, and now a bare Layers mark behind a hairline rather than a pill with a word on it —
// and the machine moved up to the pane header, onto the end of the path line beside the cache
// reading (agent-chat.tsx draws it). The STATE never moved either: it stays on the pane header's dot
// (named, so a reader still gets it without paint) and on the dashboard.
//
// WHY THE GENERAL PART IS FIRST. It is the part that is ALWAYS there. The harness section is
// absent on a bare shell, on grok, on opencode, and whenever the operator has the Settings switch
// off — so leading with it would make the row's left edge mean a different thing per pane, and the
// thumb could not learn one position. The left edge is Keys on every pane there is.
//
// EVERY PILL IS AN ICON AND A WORD, IN BOTH PARTS, AND THE ROW OVERFLOWS BECAUSE OF IT. The
// general part was icon-only for half a day, and Altan's verdict on it was that it "looks alien to
// what we've added now for harness specific stuff": two parts that are meant to read as one belt
// cannot hold two different kinds of pill. So the words came back, and the cost was paid in
// scroll rather than in shape.
//
// The numbers, measured in the playground at a 382px row, deviceScaleFactor 2:
//
//  * The general run with words was 396px as an outlined capsule — wider than the row on its own,
//    so the harness half started at 418px and neither its mark nor Model was visible at rest on a
//    Claude pane. Icon-only it was 244px and left ~120px of tint showing. That is the trade, made
//    knowingly.
//  * The belt gave a little of it back without touching a label: the capsule's own `px-1` and its
//    2px of reserved border are gone (−10px), and the wide 10px gap that used to separate the two
//    capsules is now the belt's ordinary 6px pill gap (−4px). The general pills' own gap went the
//    other way, 4px → 6px, because without a capsule around them a 4px run reads as one smear.
//  * 20px came back earlier by tightening STRIP_ROW_PILL to `px-2` (416px → 396px), which is as far
//    as padding goes before the pills stop looking like pills. Nothing else was cut: not a label,
//    not the type size, not the harness mark.
//  * The row is a scroller by design and the edge mask already says "there is more this way", which
//    is the answer it was built to give. One thumb-flick reaches the harness section.
//
// ONE SCALE FOR THE WHOLE BELT. The default preserves the compact belt; Settings can enlarge it.
// The root
// carries `--belt-scale` inline, from the dash pref `beltScale` (1 default, 1.3 Large, 1.5
// Larger), and `index.css` derives every size on the belt from it: the band (`--belt-band`), its
// padding, the pill height, the icon-only pills' width, the icons and the words. Nothing on the belt
// picks a size of its own any more, so nothing can grow out of step. The px figures in the comments
// below are the scale-1 belt they were measured on; at the default scale the band is 40px (4 + 32 +
// 4), the pills 32px, the icons 16px. The key rail and every other strip are untouched: the
// `--belt-*` properties exist only under this root.
//
// The general pills DRAW a short word and ANNOUNCE the full one (`word` vs `label` below): the row
// has one word of room per pill, and "Type into terminal" and "Display settings" are still what a
// screen reader hears and what a test addresses.

/**
 * Which thumb the belt is laid out for (the Settings "Hand" choice, `hooks/use-display-prefs.ts`).
 * `"right"` is the shipped layout and renders byte for byte as it always did. `"left"` is its true
 * mirror, not a re-ordering of parts: the pinned block (the Switch mark, Changes, the composer's X,
 * and the fade they stand on) sits at the belt's LEFT end, still directly above Send; the scrolling
 * pills run right to left, so the general part leads from the RIGHT end with Keys the rightmost
 * pill and the harness section stands to its left; the belt rests scrolled to its right end and
 * scrolling reveals the rest toward the left. What a pill SAYS does not mirror: an icon then its
 * word, read left to right, whatever side of the belt it stands on.
 *
 * It is `direction: rtl` on the scroller and on each run of pills (and `ltr` back on the pills),
 * not `flex-row-reverse` and not a render-order reversal. A right-to-left scroller is the one shape
 * every engine agrees on: it rests at its right end with `scrollLeft` 0, scrolls into negative
 * `scrollLeft`, and counts its overflow toward the left. The DOM, and so the tab and reading order,
 * is the right-hand one: Keys first, the harness section after it, the pinned block last.
 *
 * Everything below that says "the right end" is the pinned end of the RIGHT hand; read it as the
 * left end under `hand="left"`. The trailing spacer stays a trailing child (so it lands at the left
 * end of a right-to-left row), the fade runs the other way, the scroller's own edge mask moves to
 * the right, and the pinned pills' order and hit-box reach mirror.

 *  - `active:bg-foreground/15` is visible on the belt's plain chrome in both themes.
 *  - `active:scale-[0.92]` OVERRIDES `ui/button.tsx`'s base `active:scale-[0.98]` — same class
 *    group, same single `active:` modifier, so `cn()`'s `twMerge` keeps this one (it is appended
 *    after the base string, at the Button component's own `cn()` call). `motion-reduce:` then
 *    cancels it back to `scale-100` for an operator who asked the OS for less motion — the same
 *    idiom `app-header.tsx`'s `motion-reduce:transition-none` uses, relying on Tailwind emitting a
 *    media-wrapped variant AFTER the plain one so it wins the cascade without a merge conflict (a
 *    `motion-safe:` gate on the plain rule would not: its modifier SET differs from the base rule's,
 *    so `twMerge` would keep both, and which wins would depend on that same cascade order anyway —
 *    cancelling is the one path that is unambiguous). The tint is untouched by either: a colour
 *    change is not the motion the preference asks Collie to drop.
 *  - `hover:bg-foreground/8`, a softer step below the active tint, plain `hover:` — the belt's own
 *    general pills (`OFF` below) already hover unguarded through the ghost variant, so a
 *    `(hover: hover)` gate here would make these two pills the one exception on the row.
 *  - `duration-[120ms]` is the app's own tap speed (`ui/strip-host.tsx`'s `SWAP_CLASS`), layered
 *    onto the base `transition-all` — no new transition-property, just a faster one.
 *  - No size, border or padding changes in any state, so the 44px+ answered box
 *    (`STRIP_ROW_PILL`'s `::before`) and the belt's height never move under a thumb.
 *  - Nothing added for iOS: the pills are real `<button>` elements via `ui/button.tsx`, the same
 *    element every other pressable row in this app uses with a bare `active:` class and no
 *    touchstart shim (`command-palette.tsx`, `space-overview.tsx`, `agent-card.tsx`) — `:active`
 *    already fires on tap there without one, and there is no precedent in this tree for adding one. */

      {/* OverflowEdges measures this scroller and fades only the end that still hides something.
          `cue="none"` is this belt's own pick: a chevron was tried here for one commit, but the
          belt's own tint plus the fade already say the row scrolls, and the chevron sat under the
          fixed Switch pill's own hit box (below) and could not be tapped anyway — so the mark is
          gone and the fade carries the whole of the cue (operator's call, 2026-09-14).
          `edges="left"` is the OTHER half of that call: with a handle pinned, the Switch block below
          paints its OWN 8px fade at the belt's right end, always, whatever the scroll position — so
          a right mask from THIS primitive would stack a second, scroll-dependent fade on top of it.
          At rest the two together read as one wide fade; the moment the scroller reaches its end and
          this primitive's own mask drops out (nothing left to hide), only the Switch block's constant
          8px remains and the fade visibly SHRINKS — Altan, from the phone: "the fade is longer by
          default than when I scroll to the very right." `edges="left"` makes the right fade the
          Switch block's alone, constant in every scroll state, and keeps this primitive's own mask on
          the left, where it still means something once scrolled. Under `hand="left"` all of this runs
          the other way round: the block's fade is at the LEFT, so this primitive paints `"right"` only,
          and it measures a right-to-left scroller (its `scrollLeft` is 0 at rest and negative when
          panned). A caller with no handle passes no
          `edges` at all — the default `"both"` is unchanged.
          `pl-3` stays fixed (paired with the `-mx-3` above, the route's own gutter); the scroller
          carries no `paddingRight` at all — see the trailing spacer, a sibling of the last pill
          inside this same scroller, for why the room the Switch block needs is bought with a real
          flex child rather than padding.
          The scroller's own `gap-1.5` stands — 6px is the belt's ONE pill gap, between the general
          pills, and between the last of them and the harness section's edge. The old `gap-2.5`
          override is gone with the capsules: a wider gap around a group was the separator when the
          groups were floating boxes, and the section's tint is the separator now.
          `py-1` OVERRIDES `STRIP_SCROLLER`'s OWN `py-1.5` ON THIS SCROLLER ALONE — the operator's
          pick, "Option 6" of the belt-shade deck (playground, removed 2026-09-14 once it had served;
          see git history) shrank it further, to `py-0`, the pill's own height alone, 32px; the phone
          read that as too thin, so it came back up to `py-1`, 40px — the pill's 32px plus 4px above
          and below, still short of the 44px `STRIP_TAP_TARGET` answers for and short of `py-1.5`'s
          44px too. The key rail keeps `STRIP_SCROLLER`'s shipped `py-1.5` unmodified — it is a
          different scroller, not this one, and nothing here touches it.
          `overflow-y-hidden` is the fix for a bug that `py-0` reopened and `py-1` does not retire:
          `STRIP_TAP_TARGET`'s `::before` still reaches its full 46px of hit box, and even a 40px
          scroller has only 4px of padding to spare on each side, not the 6px `py-1.5` used to — so
          the `::before` still overflows the scroller's box, and `overflow-x: auto` forces
          `overflow-y` to compute to `auto` too, which turns that overflow into a real vertical
          scrollbar under a thumb. `STRIP_SCROLLER` keeps forcing `overflow-x-auto`; this belt alone
          forces the other axis shut.
          SCALED since 2026-09-23: `py-1` is `py-(--belt-pad)` now, 4px at the default scale and 5px
          and 6px at the larger two, and the pills' `::before` reaches exactly that far again
          (`--belt-reach`, STRIP_ROW_PILL), so every pill answers the whole band. */}

                row and the harness section is itself a nested `flex` row (`BELT_SECTION`), so the
                last pill that actually overflows sits two levels down, inside a grandchild of the
                scroller. Chrome does not reliably fold a scroller's own trailing padding into the

                padded element itself — measured on a Claude pane at 390px: with `paddingRight`
                set to the Switch block's own measured width, the last pill's right edge still
                landed ~5px past the hairline's left edge at `scrollLeft` max, i.e. still under the
                fade. `shrink-0` and an explicit inline width sidestep the whole question — a real
                child always counts toward `scrollWidth`, at any nesting depth. `aria-hidden`

                {@link useSwitchBlockWidth} exactly the way the removed padding used to, plus
                {@link BELT_END_AIR} when the Clear pill stands in the block. */}

          why the scroll cue steps around it, and `handle` for why it stands here at all.
          It is a SIBLING of the OverflowEdges wrapper, and that is load-bearing: a mask applies to
          its element's whole subtree (overflow-edges.tsx says so at the middle div), so a pill
          inside the wrapper would fade out with the scrolling pills exactly where the belt
          overflows — which is always, once a pill is pinned. `z-10` puts it over the scroller, so a
          pill that pans under the fade cannot take the tap.
          THE FADE IS ONE `bg-chrome` LAYER UNDER THE MASK. It is the Switch cell's OWN ground — the
          composer's chrome the belt now shares (see the header above) — and it exists so a scrolling
          pill disappears UNDER this cell instead of stopping dead against it, fading in over the
          first 8px. This keeps the last action close to Changes at scroll end. While the band carried
          its own tint, the fade was two stacked layers (chrome over the tint) so the patch would not
          read as a hole;
          with the belt on plain chrome one layer is the whole recipe.
          THIS OUTER SPAN IS `pointer-events-none`, AND NOT JUST THE FADE LAYERS INSIDE IT. A plain
          `<span>` sized by flex still hits-tests over its whole box, padding included — so the old
          64px `pl-16` lead-in, drawn only as a fade, was silently eating taps meant for whatever scrolled
          underneath it, the belt's own right chevron among them (that chevron is gone now, but a
          pill scrolled to the belt's end hits the same wall). Pointer events are switched back on
          one element in, on the actual cell (hairline + button below), so the Switch pill answers a
          tap only from ITS OWN drawn cell outward — its reach stops at the hairline, the cell's own
          left edge, never past it into the scroller.
          `switchBlock.ref` lands HERE, on this outer span — the whole pinned box, `pr-3` and `pl-2`
          included, is exactly the width the scroller's trailing spacer must match (see
          {@link useSwitchBlockWidth}), so measuring anything narrower (the inner button alone, say)
          would under-report it and the last pill would scroll in under the fade again. */}

              the mark, inside a 30% accent border on a 10% accent ground, because this is the one
              control on the belt that does not operate the composer — Keys, Type, Quick, Agent and
              Display all act on the box below, and this one LEAVES the pane. Altan's verdict once it
              shipped: "the switch button is taking up too much room for my taste, I'd argue we can
              just have the icon." So the word, the border and the ground are gone, and what says
              "the scroller ends here" is the hairline on its left — the belt's own rule colour, the
              one it already draws under itself, never a heavy edge. The mark keeps the accent, which
              is now the whole of what sets this control apart from the pills it stands beside.

              46px answered through its `::before`, exactly like every other pill here. A literally
              drawn 44px box would set the belt's height on its own and push the composer down.
