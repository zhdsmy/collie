// The blocks of a session stream: user turns, replies, thinking, notices and tool cards.
//
// These draw a session as the agent's own record has it (`lib/chat-items.ts`), which is the half of
// Chat that a journal can feed. They came out of the session-stream prototype, where they were built
// against THESE primitives from the start — `MarkdownText` for agent prose, `DiffView` for a diff,
// `mirror-space` for command output, `OneOf` for every reserved slot — so the move changed the
// address and not the drawing.
//
// ── WHAT A CARD CANNOT DO ON ITS OWN, AND THE SLOT THAT SAYS SO ──────────────
// A card may have something waiting on it: a permission dialog, a question. Collie has no channel
// that can say so. A session log records that a dialog was ANSWERED, never that one is open, so file
// mode emits no such event and there is no collie code path that could fill it. The card therefore
// carries a {@link CardWaiting} SLOT that a host fills, and collie declares no `Ask`, no `Answer`
// and no channel: a seam with no caller is a guess (ADR 0073 point 8), and the first real dialog
// channel deserves to shape its own types rather than inherit a prototype's.
//
// The one filler there is says only where to look, never what to ask. A question tool call
// (`kind: "question"`) draws what it asked and, once answered, what was chosen; while it waits, the
// dock below the stream already holds the pane's own dialog as tappable options, and
// `lib/question-waiting.ts` fills the slot's `note` with a line saying so, when the join is exact.
// The options on the card are therefore never buttons: answering lives in one place.
//
// ── TRANSLATED, SINCE THE SCREEN THAT MOUNTS THEM LANDED ────────────────────
// M41/10 left the copy here as English literals on purpose: nothing rendered these, so no operator
// could read a word of them. M41/11 mounts them (`components/session-stream.tsx`) and pays the debt
// it named — every string below is a `t()` key with an entry in all seven catalogues.
//
// EVERY COMPONENT HERE THAT CALLS `t()` ALSO CALLS `useLocale()`. That is the repo rule (CLAUDE.md
// → Frontend data layer) and it is load bearing twice over: `t()` reads a module store at call
// time, so a component needs a reason to render again when the answer changes — and two of these
// are `memo`, so a parent re-rendering is not that reason. What a card DRAWS is still never
// translated: a path, a command, a query, a URL, a sub-agent's name, a tool's own name and a
// harness's own name are the agent's words or the machine's, and they go through as they arrived.
