            IT STAYS IN THE FOOTER, AND IT IS NOT A PILL. The "sent" ping already IS one — send()
            publishes `composer.status.sent` on the same line, and the top pills carry it. What is
            left here is the other half, and it is a VERIFICATION surface: the ✓ says the text was
            seen in the input box before the submit key went out (see send()), and this holds the
            words themselves on screen until the mirror echoes them back, so the operator can check
            what landed instead of tapping Send a second time. That is a CONDITION with a real
            duration — the echo gap — and the gap regularly outlives a pill's 2.5s. A pill would also
            truncate to a line of chrome, which is the one thing this must not do. */}

            Every strip below arrives and leaves through `Collapse`, which is the only sanctioned way
            an in-flow surface appears at all. Before this they were bare conditionals, so each one
            TELEPORTED the composer up by its own height the moment its condition flipped — reported
            from the outside as "a notification in the footer pushed content up".
            WHAT BELONGS HERE AND WHAT BELONGS IN THE TOP PILLS. An EVENT — a transient confirmation
            with no controls — belongs in the pills (lib/status, `setStatus`), where it costs the
            layout nothing and dismisses itself. A CONDITION belongs here, at the surface it is about,
            for as long as it is true. Sorted that way, every strip in this footer is a condition and
            each one carries its own controls: the take-over preview (Take over), the password notice
            (Use Type / ✕), the two armed-mode strips (Stop / ✕), and the draft-too-long line, which
            lasts as long as the text does and would re-fire on every keystroke as a pill. The one
            genuine event in this region — "sent" — is ALREADY a pill (`composer.status.sent`); what
            stays here under that name is the verification half, and the strip itself says why. */}

            typing streams straight in. It NEVER writes into the phone-owned input; only the explicit
