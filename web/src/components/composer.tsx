              It is the same problem split in half: Keys exists because the phone keyboard cannot
              send Esc/Tab/arrows/chords, this exists because it cannot send bare printable letters —
              so someone who wants to press `b` looks in this row first. It is also used in bursts
              (a picker, a y/n prompt) and then not for days, which is the wrong shape for a
              permanent fixture on the app's most-used control: a split Send button cost a third of
              the primary action's width every day to serve a mode used on a few of them.
              Unlike its neighbours this toggles state instead of opening a dock — the armed strip
              above the input is what makes that visible. Arming is still an explicit NAMED choice,
              which is what keeps an accidental touch from quietly wiring the keyboard to a live
              terminal; see use-direct-typing.ts for the rest of that argument. */}
