   *  • **A password prompt is on screen** (ADR 0017). Typing behaves the same way there — the pane
   *    gets nothing until the operator acts — and a spoken secret is the last thing to auto-submit.
   *  • **The composer can't send at all** (locked, or a dialog owns the keyboard). `send()` would

            buttons the rest of a 390px phone. */}
        {/* THE STATUS BAND IS GONE, AND THIS IS WHERE IT STOOD.

            It was 14px, roomy-only, bounded by a hairline on both edges, and it read as one
            sentence: the machine every button below writes to, then what that machine's pane was
            doing. Altan, on the phone, after the belt landed: "we should address the small status
            line with the server and status, the server is still necessary somewhere, but the status
            is unnecessary at this place."

            SO THE TWO RUNS WENT DIFFERENT WAYS. The machine moved ONE row down, onto the actions
            belt — and then UP, into the pane header, under the cache reading, once the belt's right
            end was needed for the Switch pill (agent-chat.tsx draws it, actions-row.tsx says why).
            It is a `variant="tag"` either way: the 10px uppercase caption was sized for this band
            and reads as a word that fell off something anywhere else.

            THE STATUS WORD WAS DELETED, NOT MOVED, AND THAT NEEDED ONE CHECK FIRST. The word was
            here because a 10px dot encodes this range in HUE ALONE and the range does not survive
            it: on the app's own `--status-*` tokens a deuteranope reads blocked / working / done as
            one colour in light theme, and "needs you" against "done" collapses in both
            (status-badge.tsx holds the measurement). Deleting a coloured word is therefore only
            safe while the state is still readable without colour SOMEWHERE. It is: the pane
            header's agent tile badges a StatusDot that is NAMED — `label={statusLabel(...)}`, the
            one named dot in the app — so a screen reader still gets "needs you" from the header,
            and a shell pane's tile carries an `sr-only` "shell" for the same reason
            (agent-chat.tsx says both at the line). The dashboard states it in words as well. No
            visible word was added anywhere to pay for this one; that was the point of removing it.

            WHAT THE REMOVAL BOUGHT, MEASURED AT 390px: 22px off the stack — the band's own 14px
            (1 + 12 + 1) plus the 8px `mt-2` that separated it from the buttons. The belt's top
            margin absorbed that decision: see `mt-1.5` on the roomy ActionsRow below, which is the
            air between the dock/handle above and the belt now that there is nothing between them.

            The dock still takes NO top padding: its top rule and fill live on the chrome block in
            `agent-chat.tsx`, because the swipe handle stands on that same ground and the boundary
            against the terminal is drawn once, above everything the thumb operates. */}

            Every strip below arrives and leaves through `Collapse`, which is the only sanctioned way
            an in-flow surface appears at all. Before this they were bare conditionals, so each one
            TELEPORTED the composer up by its own height the moment its condition flipped — reported
            from the outside as "a notification in the footer pushed content up".
            WHAT BELONGS HERE AND WHAT BELONGS IN THE TOP PILLS. An EVENT — a transient confirmation
            with no controls — belongs in the pills (lib/status, `setStatus`), where it costs the
            layout nothing and dismisses itself. A CONDITION belongs here, at the surface it is about,
            for as long as it is true. Sorted that way, every strip in this footer is a condition and
            each one carries its own controls: the password notice (Use Type / ✕), the two armed-mode strips (Stop / ✕), and the draft-too-long line, which
            lasts as long as the text does and would re-fire on every keystroke as a pill. The one
            genuine event in this region — "sent" — is ALREADY a pill (`composer.status.sent`); what
            stays here under that name is the verification half, and the strip itself says why. */}

        {/* ── ONE BOX, ONE ROW: THE FIELD, ATTACH, THE PRIMARY ACTION ──────────────────────
            The field, the attach control and Send used to be three shapes on one line: a
            bordered field with a button tucked into its bottom-right corner, and a round primary
            action floating beside it. They are one bordered container now, ported by hand from the
            prompt-input pattern (ADR 0057). For one round the box also carried a toolbar row under
            the field; on a phone that was a second row of height on an EMPTY composer, so the two
            buttons came back inline (ADR 0057, amended 2026-09-22).

            ATTACH STANDS AT THE RIGHT, NEXT TO THE PRIMARY ACTION, AS IT DID BEFORE THIS FILE
            MADE IT ONE BOX. It sat at the box's left edge for one round; Altan asked for it back
            beside Send, so the row reads field, attach, primary action (ADR 0057, amended again
            2026-09-22).

            THE ROW. `flex items-end gap-1 p-1`: the field (`flex-1 min-w-0`), attach, the primary
            action. `items-end` pins both buttons to the bottom edge while a long draft grows the
            field upward to its cap, which is where a thumb already is. `p-1` is 4px, exactly the
            reach of `TOOLBAR_TAP_TARGET`, so an empty box is 36 + 8 = 44px inside its border.

            THE FRAME IS HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE, AND THERE IS ONE. The border is unconditional and
            only its colour moves on focus, so the box never resizes under the caret (DESIGN.md §2),
            and `focus-within:ring-1` doubles it to a 2px line as a box-shadow, which costs no
            layout. It WAS an outline two pixels outside the border as well, and a ring-coloured
            border plus an offset outline drew two frames around one field. Do not bring an
            `outline-offset-*` back: one frame is the focus mark, and it is still a visible one.

            No wrapper padding above the box any more. It was `pt-1`, there only to keep the old
            outline's 4px reach off the belt; the ring reaches 1px, and the belt's own `mb-1`
            clears that.

            `relative` is the anchor `AnchoredMenu` positions against, so the attach picker opens
            above the whole box, right-aligned against it — which now sits close to the attach
            button itself, one button-width and a gap in from the box's own right edge
            (ui/anchored-menu.tsx carries that measurement). The menu is still a child of the box
            rather than of the button: it is absolutely positioned, so it takes no place in the row,
            and anchoring it to the box is what keeps it lined up above the box's own right edge
            regardless of which control stands nearest that edge.

            THE BELT IS NOT PART OF THIS BOX. Keys / Type / Quick / Agent / Display stay above it
            (actions-row.tsx). They open docks that fill half the viewport; the box holds the two
            controls that act on the draft in front of you, and nothing else moves in.

            The machine this write lands on is NOT in here, and must not move in. It was, for one
            round, docked at the field's right edge, and it cost 60px of typing width on a crew,
            out of the widest part of the composer. It answers the same question from the belt
            above, which is equally at the write surface and costs the draft nothing. */}

              // start 4px from the border — the box's padding alone, with nothing of the field's to
              // add to it. Attach used to stand there and supplied that room as its own width; now

              // field now, so nothing inside the field needs a strip kept clear for either of them —
              // the field's right side takes no padding of its own, and the box's `gap-1` to attach

              even now that attach stands near the box's own right edge: the panel is `right-0
              min-w-44` against its anchor, and the gap between attach and that edge is NOT fixed —
              the primary action beside it is a size-9 icon square most of the time but widens into
              a text button ("Type anyway?" / "Really send?") the moment a confirm is armed, which
              would slide the menu sideways if it followed the button instead of the box. Anchoring
              to the box keeps the picker's own right edge pinned to the box's right edge no matter
              which shape the primary action is wearing.
              Two rows, no confirm, each one opens a native picker, which is its own decision
              point. The menu closes BEFORE the click so it is not left standing behind the
              system UI, and the click still counts as the user gesture the browser requires
