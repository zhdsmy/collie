   * HANDS-FREE: it goes out through `send()`, the same guarded path the Send button uses, with every
   * pre-flight and the reply guard intact (ADR 0029 — through the guards, never around them). Three
   * things withdraw it, and all three fall back to inserting rather than refusing:
   *
   *  • **A draft is already in the box.** Merging dictated words onto text the operator typed and
   *    sending the result would send a sentence nobody has read. The two get combined in the box
   *    instead, where the Send button is still theirs to press.
   *  • **A password prompt is on screen** (ADR 0017). Typing behaves the same way there — the pane
   *    gets nothing until the operator acts — and a spoken secret is the last thing to auto-submit.
   *  • **The composer can't send at all** (locked, or a dialog owns the keyboard). `send()` would
   *    refuse anyway; inserting keeps the words.

        {/* THE STATUS BAND — A STATUS LINE, NOT A HEADING, AND NOW A REGION OF ITS OWN.

            It used to be 12px of `pt-3` reserved at the top of the controls row, with its two runs
            lifted out of the flex flow into one `absolute` box. It is now a real box, a sibling
            above the row, because the operator asked for a bottom rule, and a rule cannot be drawn
            on padding. What it SAYS is unchanged: it reads as ONE SENTENCE —
            the machine every button on the row (and the field below) writes to, and what that
            machine's pane is doing. It replaced the word "Controls", which named a row whose five
            buttons already carry their own labels.

            WHY HERE AND NOT IN THE FIELD. The host was docked inside the text box for one round.
            The reasoning survives ("which machine will this land on" is asked while writing, not
            while reading) but the price does not: docked, it took 60px out of the typing area, the
            widest and most contested part of the composer. This band is at the same write surface
            and costs the typing area nothing.

            WHY THE STATUS WORD CAME DOWN HERE. It was the pane header's caption line, and once the
            host left that line it was ONE word holding a whole line of a 60px row — the operator
            asked for the top back. It could not simply be deleted: on the app's own `--status-*`
            tokens a deuteranope reads blocked / working / done as one colour in light theme, and
            "needs you" against "done" collapses in both, so the DOT alone cannot carry the range
            (status-badge.tsx holds the measurement). The dot stays badged on the agent's tile in the
            header, welded to its subject; the word stands here, where the same question is being
            asked about the same machine.

            NOTHING HERE CAN MOVE ANYTHING. Both runs state the same 12px line box (`text-[10px]/3`,
            one utility — tailwind-merge deletes an earlier `leading-*` when a later `text-<size>`
            follows it in the same cn()). `h-[14px]` then STATES the band's height rather than
            letting it be the sum of whatever stands in it, so a solo install (where HostChip renders
            null, its hide rule unchanged, leaving the word alone), a pack, and a gone pane (no word
            at all) are identical BY CONSTRUCTION and not by three occupants happening to agree.
            `text-[10px]/3` is stated on the BAND as
            well as on both runs, and that is load-bearing rather than decorative: a block layer
            inside the slot takes its line box from its OWN inherited strut, so without it the 14px
            page strut won and the band measured 25px instead of 14px.
            The WORD's own width is the case padding cannot reserve — "needs you" is 54.6px and
            "done" 27.9px — so it stands in a slot sized to every word it can hold, which is what
            `StatusWordSlot` is for; the machine's name truncates into what is left, always the same
            amount of it. DESIGN.md §2: reserve, never reflow.

            THE GROUND IS THE PAGE COLOUR, PER DESIGN.md §4: CHROME SEPARATES WITH A RULE, NOT A
            FILL. A fill was tried here and measured — 1.19:1 against the dock below, 1.09:1 /
            1.10:1 against the terminal mirror above, both themes, against a `border-b border-rule`
            doing 1.45:1 light and 2.19:1 dark — and the rule was doing between 1.2x and 2x more of
            the separating in light, and all of it in dark, where the fill read as a continuation of
            the terminal rather than as a band of chrome. It is gone; the band is unpainted, and the
            two rules are what tell it apart from what stands either side of it.

            THE RULES ARE `--border`, NOT `--rule`, SINCE THE 2026-08-31 ROUND. The operator read
            the pair as too loud — two 24% hairlines 14px apart make a bright sandwich around 10px
            type — and the token doctrine agrees with the eye: --rule cuts BETWEEN regions of
            chrome, and both of this band's neighbours are the same chrome surface (the handle
            above, the controls below; the regional cut against the terminal is the chrome block's
            own top rule in agent-chat.tsx). These are component edges inside one surface, which is
            what --border (12%) is for. Nothing about the geometry below changes: the centring fix
            was the SYMMETRY of `border-y`, never the weight of the lines.

            IT IS BOUNDED ON BOTH EDGES NOW — `border-y`, and that is the round's actual fix. The
            band had a rule below it and 10px of the dock's own `pt-2.5` above it, which is why it
            read as uncentred no matter what the numbers said: the box the EYE draws ran from the
            dock's top rule to the band's bottom rule, ~23px of one unbroken ground, and the words
            sat at the bottom of it. Measured on the page (390px, DPR 3, dark) the geometry inside
            the 13px band was already right to half a pixel — caps 3.0 → 10.0 in a 0 → 13 box — so
            there was nothing to centre BETTER. There was a box to state. The band now states it:
            a rule above, a rule below, nothing between them but the two runs.

            The 10px did not vanish, it moved BELOW the band, onto the controls row — `mt-2.5`
            then, `mt-2` since the 2026-08-31 shave (with `mb-2` going to `mb-1.5` beside it, 4px
            returned in all) — where it separates the band from the buttons instead of pretending
            to be part of it.
            The dock therefore takes NO top padding at all, and its top rule and fill moved out to
            the chrome block in `agent-chat.tsx` — the swipe handle stands on that same ground, so
            the boundary against the terminal is drawn once, above everything the thumb operates.
            Two components drawing one boundary is a fault this codebase has already fixed twice
            (`space-strip.tsx` / `tab-strip.tsx`).

            THE STACK GOT 9px SHORTER: −10px of dock padding, +1px for the band's new top rule.

            AND THE 1px NUDGE IS GONE WITH IT. The band used to carry `pt-px`, which existed to pay
            for a rule on ONE edge: `items-center` centres in the CONTENT box, the band the eye read
            was the border box, and with a hairline below and none above the two centres were half a
            pixel apart. `border-y` makes the box symmetric by construction, so there is nothing left
            to compensate for and a compensation still applied would tip it the other way. Both
            spellings were measured on the page, 390px at DPR 3, as ink rows in the band's own 14px
            border box (rules at 0 → 1 and 13 → 14):

              with `pt-px`   caps 4.00 → 11.00, centroid 7.33 · all ink centroid 7.83
              without        caps 3.00 → 10.00, centroid 6.33 · all ink centroid 6.83

            against a border-box centre of 7.00. The eye centres the CLUSTER, not the capital
            letters — the host's glyph is part of the line — so the all-ink number is the one that
            decides, and it goes from 0.83px low to 0.17px high. The height is simply stated
            (14px = 1 + 12 + 1) and `items-center` does the rest. The host's glyph stays `size-2.5`
            in this variant (host-chip.tsx states why at the line): 10px in a 12px content box
            clears both rules instead of touching one.

            Nothing about the reserve changes: the slot still stacks every word (§2), and the height
            is the same 14px solo, on a pack, and on a gone pane.

            FULL-BLEED, and the content still at 10px. `-mx-3` cancels the dock's `px-3` so both
            rules run edge to edge — one that stopped short would not separate the regions it
            sits between. `px-2.5` then puts the content back at the 10px inset the controls row
            asked for, so nothing on this line moved by a pixel: the band is what absorbs the old
            `-mx-0.5`, a 2px overhang that was invisible on this unpainted strip either way. */}

              so someone who wants to press `b` looks in this row first. It is also used in bursts
              (a picker, a y/n prompt) and then not for days, which is the wrong shape for a
              permanent fixture on the app's most-used control: a split Send button cost a third of
              the primary action's width every day to serve a mode used on a few of them.

              terminal; see use-direct-typing.ts for the rest of that argument. */}

            Every strip below arrives and leaves through `Collapse`, which is the only sanctioned way
            an in-flow surface appears at all. Before this they were bare conditionals, so each one
            TELEPORTED the composer up by its own height the moment its condition flipped — reported
            from the outside as "a notification in the footer pushed content up".
            WHAT BELONGS HERE AND WHAT BELONGS IN THE TOP PILLS. An EVENT — a transient confirmation
            with no controls — belongs in the pills (lib/status, `setStatus`), where it costs the
            layout nothing and dismisses itself. A CONDITION belongs here, at the surface it is about,
            for as long as it is true. Sorted that way, every strip in this footer is a condition and
            each one carries its own controls: the take-over preview (Take over), the password notice
            (Use Type / ✕), the two armed-mode strips (Stop / ✕), and the draft-too-long line, which
            lasts as long as the text does and would re-fire on every keystroke as a pill. The one
            genuine event in this region — "sent" — is ALREADY a pill (`composer.status.sent`); what
            stays here under that name is the verification half, and the strip itself says why. */}

            typing streams straight in. It NEVER writes into the phone-owned input; only the explicit
            Take over copies the text here. No dismiss — it's honest state and persists until the user
