// The harness section of the actions belt: the running agent's own slash commands, sitting inside
// the one scrolling row above the input (components/actions-row.tsx). Model, Effort, Compact and
// Resume on a Claude Code pane; Codex, pi and omp get their own. The table is lib/harness-bar.ts —
// nothing here decides what the buttons are.
//
// It exists because Altan drives Claude Code from the phone and wants those four under the thumb
// rather than three taps down inside the Agent palette.
//
// The harness mark and coloured icons identify the command group on the shared composer ground.
// IT ADDS NO REFUSAL OF ITS OWN. `disabled` (the composer's `locked`) greys every button in place,
// the way the key rail greys a key the multiplexer refuses rather than removing it. Everything else
// is refused inside `send()`: a dialog on screen is refused there with the existing status line, and
// a WORKING pane is not refused at all, because the Agent palette does not refuse one either. One
// gate, one place. The checkmark is the honest signal — it appears only when `send()` resolved true,
// so a tap that was refused shows nothing and the label stays put.
//
// It does not collapse or animate. A section that appeared and disappeared would move the input
// under the thumb, and DESIGN.md §2 says reserve, never reflow — so its presence is decided by the
// pane's agent, which does not change while the pane is on screen.
