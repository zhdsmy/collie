// The harness section of the actions belt: the running agent's own slash commands, sitting inside
// the one scrolling row above the input (components/actions-row.tsx). Model, Effort, Compact and
// Resume on a Claude Code pane; Codex, pi and omp get their own. The table is lib/harness-bar.ts —
// nothing here decides what the buttons are.
//
// It exists because Altan drives Claude Code from the phone and wants those four under the thumb
// rather than three taps down inside the Agent palette.
//
// IT IS THE ONE DRAWN SECTION OF THE BELT. These buttons do not do what their neighbours do: a
// general action opens one of Collie's own docks, and one of these types into somebody else's
// program. So this run sits in a SECTION of the band (BELT_SECTION) — square corners, spanning the
// belt's full inner height, tinted with the harness's brand and drawing its icons in that colour.
// Collie's own controls stand on the belt's bare ground beside it, so the tint boundary alone is
// what tells the two apart. No divider, and never a thick left border.
//
// THE BLACK-BRANDED FALLBACK IS THE ONE CASE THAT NEEDS A HAIRLINE, AND IT IS MEASURED. A brand
// with no legible accent (Codex, pi — both officially black) falls back to the app's muted ground;
// see `accent` in agent-icon-data.ts for why absent is a real answer there. On the belt's own
// ground that fallback stops separating in dark: `--muted` is rgb 38 there and the belt is rgb 37,
// which is 1.02:1 — the section would simply vanish. (Light is 1.13:1, which reads.) So the muted
// section, and only it, colours BELT_SECTION's reserved left edge with `border-l-border`. The
// tinted sections take no border at all: Claude's 14% wash measures 1.12:1 light and 1.22:1 dark
// against the belt, which is the boundary doing its own job.
//
// IT OPENS WITH THE HARNESS'S OWN MARK. The first thing inside the section is the agent's icon, and
// it is decoration: no hit box, no name in the accessibility tree, which already names the group.
// The tint alone said "not Collie's"; the mark says WHOSE, at a glance and before a word is read.
// Altan asked for exactly that after the two rows were merged into one — the row he tested "lacks
// some structure", five identical glyphs and then a coloured blob with no owner on it.
//
// IT ADDS NO REFUSAL OF ITS OWN. `disabled` (the composer's `locked`) greys every button in place,
// the way the key rail greys a key the multiplexer refuses rather than removing it. Everything else
// is refused inside `send()`: a dialog on screen is refused there with the existing status line, and
// a WORKING pane is not refused at all, because the Agent palette does not refuse one either. One
// gate, one place. The checkmark is the honest signal — it appears only when `send()` resolved true,
// so a tap that was refused shows nothing and the label stays put.
//
// It does not collapse or animate. A section that appeared and disappeared would move the input
// under the thumb, and DESIGN.md §2 says reserve, never reflow — so its presence is decided by the
// pane's agent, which does not change while the pane is on screen.
