/**
 * The dashboard's way into /crew — the third entry point, beside the switcher sheet's footer and the
 * Settings card.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS HERE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The dashboard footer is already the screen's META zone: which bundle you're running (BuildStamp)
 * and whether a newer one exists (UpdateBanner). Both answer "how is the thing I'm looking at
 * doing", not "what should I act on" — and "how is my crew doing" is the same question one level
 * out. Putting it anywhere in `<main>` would give it a claim on the operator's attention it hasn't
 * earned: the herd list is triage, and a census is never triage.
 *
 * ── WHY A LINE AND NOT A CARD ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A card is a surface that says "read me". Its neighbours here are single muted lines, and the crew
 * has nothing urgent to say from the dashboard — the census page says it. A card would also outweigh
 * UpdateBanner, which genuinely can be urgent, and sitting above it would invert the two.
 * The Settings card earns its box because Settings is a list OF cards; this is a list of lines.
 *
 * The whole thing renders `null` when `!multi` — a solo install must see byte-identical chrome,
 * which is the milestone's rule and the reason the gate is `useCrew()` here rather than a check on
 * any loader's answer.
