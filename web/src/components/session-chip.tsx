// Renders `null` unless there is something to say, so callers may mount it unconditionally:
//
//   • the pane names no session — every un-widened read, which is every read the app made before
//     the "All sessions" view existed;
//   • the pane names the PRIMARY session — the one an absent `?s=` already means. Marking those
//     would put a chip on every row of the widened list and say nothing with it; the rows that are
//     somewhere unexpected are the ones worth marking. This is the same shape as HostChip going
//     quiet on a solo install.
//
// Not a control, for the reason HostChip is not one: two lookalike pills, one of them tappable, on
// the surface where a mis-tap means typing into the wrong terminal. The `Layers` glyph is the
// session switcher's own, so the pill and the control that changes it name the same dimension —
// the SHAPE says which is which (a pill is a fact, the switcher is a button).
//
// The registry comes from CONTEXT, not from a prop — the same seam, and for the same reason, that
// HostChip takes the crew roster from. Half the surfaces that render one of these are unit-tested
// without a router, so reading the root loader is not available (crew-provider.tsx states that
// argument at length); a prop chain reaching every list, sheet and row is a prop chain someone will
// break. With no provider the registry is empty, which reads as "nothing to say".
