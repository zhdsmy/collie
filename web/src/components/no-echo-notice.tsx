// The one thing #103 was missing: a sentence, at the moment of the refusal, that names the screen and
// points at the control that works.
//
// A password prompt is the single case where the reply guard's evidence can never arrive — `sudo`,
// `ssh` and `gpg` turn echo off, so the characters land in the pane and the terminal deliberately
// shows nothing to read back (lib/no-echo.ts). Send is right to withhold the submit key, and it will
// be right on every retry, so an operator who does not know WHY is left tapping Send at a screen that
// can never change. The reporter of #103 gave up and walked to a laptop for three days.
//
// It is a NOTICE, not a replacement for the override. The Send slot keeps offering "Type anyway?"
// exactly as before, so a false positive costs a dismissable strip rather than an action; this sits
// where the terminal-draft preview sits and says the part the status line has no room for.
//
// WHY THE HANDOFF CLEARS THE DRAFT. The composer write-through persists every keystroke to
// localStorage (lib/drafts.ts, 48h), so by the time this appears the secret is already stored — and
// `useDirectTyping` refuses to arm at all while a draft is present, which means the failed attempt
// blocks the remedy. Clearing on the way through fixes both: it is the one path where the draft is
// known to be a secret, and dropping it is what the operator wanted anyway.
