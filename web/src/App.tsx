// which unmounted the whole route tree — and with it every piece of local component state, including
// an in-progress reply draft (composer.tsx keeps its draft, upload and sheets entirely local). Coming
// back from a pause silently ate what you'd typed. Now the router stays mounted and polling is what
// pauses (use-polling's tick reads lib/idle), so resuming restores the exact screen, draft and scroll.
//
// `inert` on a display:contents wrapper takes the covered app out of focus and the a11y tree without
// generating a box, so it can't change layout — the cover already blocks pointers, this closes the
// keyboard path behind it.
