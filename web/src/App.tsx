// The idle lock COVERS the app rather than replacing it. It used to render instead of the router,
// which unmounted the whole route tree — and with it every piece of local component state, including
// an in-progress reply draft (composer.tsx keeps its draft, upload and sheets entirely local). Coming
// back from a pause silently ate what you'd typed. Now the router stays mounted and polling is what
// pauses (use-polling's tick reads lib/idle), so resuming restores the exact screen, draft and scroll.
//
// `inert` on a display:contents wrapper takes the covered app out of focus and the a11y tree without
// generating a box, so it can't change layout — the cover already blocks pointers, this closes the
// keyboard path behind it.

  // THE UPDATE SCREEN IS THE IDLE LOCK'S SECOND COUSIN, and it is mounted the same way: a sibling of
  // the wrapper it makes inert, never inside it, because a node cannot be both inert and the host of
  // the dialog that made it inert. The reading decides whether it blocks at all — an update this
  // device started blocks; one it merely heard about shows a badge (lib/update-screen.ts).
  //
  // The wrapper's `inert` is the OR of the two facts, and each of them keeps its own reason: the idle
  // lock pauses a screen nobody is touching, and this blocks a screen whose machine is being rebuilt
  // under it.
  const screen = useUpdateScreen();
  // BusyBar overlays every route (fixed, top of viewport) — a mutation anywhere shows the strip.
