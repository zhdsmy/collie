// WHICH BODY AN AGENT PANE DRAWS WHEN THE DEVICE CHOSE CHAT (1.17.0, ADR 0082 point 4).
//
// Chat reads the agent's own session log. A new pane often has none to read yet, and that is not a
// fault: Codex reports its session only on the first prompt, and pi writes its log file only after
// its first reply. Drawing the terminal until then put two bodies on a pane that had just started,
// with a swap between them that no cover hid. So a pane that is NEW draws Chat at once, with one
// quiet line that says how to begin, and the terminal is the FALLBACK for a pane whose session or
// log should have come and did not.
//
// ── EVENTS DECIDE, NEVER A CLOCK ─────────────────────────────────────────────
// Every fallback below waits for something to HAPPEN on the pane: it asks for input, or its first
// turn ends. The end of a turn is the moment a healthy harness has certainly named its session and
// written its log, so it is the moment a missing one becomes a fault rather than a wait. Nothing
// here counts seconds, except one last resort for a pane that works and never sends another event.
//
// ── THE RULE, IN ORDER ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//   1. The device chose the terminal, or this harness cannot draw Chat → terminal. So does a server
//      that said it cannot read at all (`off`): there is no event to wait for.
//   2. The pane has a session and its log is not known to be missing → chat.
//   3. Nothing to read, and this view did not see the pane start fresh → terminal at once.
//   4. Nothing to read, and the pane asked for input (blocked) → terminal at once. A dialog on an
//      empty Chat is a question the operator cannot see.
//   5. Nothing to read, and the last resort fired: the pane worked for
//      {@link LAST_RESORT_NO_JOURNAL_MS} and no event came at all → terminal.
//   6. Nothing to read, and the first turn ended:
//        - the snapshot that reports the end names no session → terminal at once;
//        - the log is still missing in the journal read STARTED AFTER that snapshot → terminal.
//          Until that read answers → start. (`settled`, see hooks/use-pane-start.ts.)
//   7. Otherwise (not worked yet, or working) → start: Chat, "Send a message to start", or the
//      working indicator.
//
// The fallback is not sticky. When the session and the log arrive later, rule 2 takes the body back
// to Chat.
//
// Pure, so the whole decision is one table test (chat-gate.test.ts). The hook that feeds it
// (hooks/use-pane-start.ts) owns the memory of what this view has seen.

 * `off`: the server says it cannot read at all, and no event will change that on this pane: reading
 * is switched off (`disabled`, `COLLIE_TRANSCRIPT=0`), or the member's Collie predates the chat route
 * (`stale`, a 404). Chat would only ever be empty, so the terminal is the body.
