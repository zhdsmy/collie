// The one place Collie asks what the runtime it landed in can actually do.
//
// Collie's bundle evaluates in four places that are NOT the same environment: a modern phone
// browser, an older WebView, the service worker (`sw.ts` — no `window`, no `document`), and jsdom
// under Vitest (no `ResizeObserver`). Every one of those questions used to be answered inline with
// a bare `typeof X === "undefined"` scattered across the module that cared, which is the shape
// `anti-slop/no-runtime-typeof` exists to collect: a representation check standing in for a
// contract. The contract is "what this runtime provides", it is answered exactly once here, and
// every call site reads a plain value.
//
// These are FUNCTIONS, not module-scope constants, on purpose: a global can appear after this
// module is first imported (a test installing a `ResizeObserver`, a polyfill loading late), and a
// constant captured at import time would answer for the wrong runtime forever.
//
// Each probe asks whether the runtime PROVIDES the capability rather than inspecting the
// representation of a name: the owner (`globalThis`, `Intl`, `AbortSignal`) is the thing that would
// provide it, and reading a missing property off it yields `undefined` without throwing. That also
// answers correctly for a test that stubs a global TO `undefined`, which a bare presence check
// would not. Works unchanged in the page, the service worker and jsdom.
//
// NOTE: this module must stay out of `src/sw.ts`'s import graph — `globalThis.window` /
// `globalThis.document` do not typecheck under the WebWorker lib (tsconfig.worker.json).
