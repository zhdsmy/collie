// line to carry the two things that actually locate a piece of work: the project, and the tab.
//
// Nothing is lost: the pane's own name (a herdr `pane.rename` label, or Claude's own `/rename`
// session name) moves down one line, where it displaces the cwd.

 *
 * `informativeCwd` is a herd-list rule and it stays one: there, line 1 IS the project, so comparing
 * the directory's own name to the project is comparing the path to the line above it. The pane
 * header's line 1 is not the project — it is `paneLabel ?? sessionName ?? "space › tab"`, so a
 * hand-set name ("logs", "crew overview") never puts the project on screen and the project-gate
 * would suppress the path that is the only thing left naming the work. Measured over the fixture
 * herd, the project gate hid the path on 14 panes of 14.
 *
 * So the question this asks is the one the reader asks: does the path show me a SEGMENT the name
 * above it does not already show? `…/workspace-sprqvntrs/openplate` under
 * `workspace-sprqvntrs › openplate` says nothing and is dropped; `…/openplate/worktrees/fix-42`
 * carries `worktrees` and `fix-42` and is kept; `~/src/sprqvntrs-api` under `logs` is kept, because
 * `logs` names no directory at all.
 *
 * Segments are compared case-insensitively against the name's own word run, split on everything a
 * path segment cannot contain — so the `›` of a breadcrumb separates two tokens rather than
 * becoming part of one. `~` and the `…` elision marker are not segments and never count.
