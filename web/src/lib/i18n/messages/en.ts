// The English dictionary — the source of truth for every string and every key.
//
// Shape rules, because the whole layer's type safety rests on them:
//   * FLAT object, dot-namespaced keys (`area.thing.part`). No nesting: a flat map is what makes
//     `keyof typeof en` a finite union of literals, which is what makes a missing translation a
//     compile error rather than a blank label at runtime.
//   * `as const` so the keys stay literal. Only English is `as const` — the other locales carry
//     different VALUES for the same keys, so they are typed `Record<MessageKey, string>`.
//   * `{name}` marks an interpolation slot; `t()` fills it. Slots are named, never positional,
//     because a translator re-orders a sentence and positions do not survive that.
//   * A plural comes as a `.one` / `.other` PAIR and is read through `tn()`, never `t()`.
//
// Seeded with the language-selector copy only — the full string sweep lands separately.

  // Updates page carries it whole.
