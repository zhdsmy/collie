// The device's own look — today one field, `font`, and the shape is an OBJECT on purpose.
//
// WHY AN OBJECT FOR ONE FIELD. This is the seed of theming: an accent colour, a density, a corner
// radius are all the same kind of decision and all belong in the same key. A bare string here would
// mean a second localStorage key per idea, a second pre-paint read in theme-init.js, and a second
// migration when the first one grew a sibling. One key that already parses as a record costs
// nothing today and is the difference between adding a field and adding a store.
//
// THE FACE IS A CLASS, NOT A PROPERTY. Nothing in this file knows what Space Grotesk's fallback
// stack is, or Aldrich's, or the system one — index.css owns all three under `:root.font-*`, and
// this module only ever swaps which class is on <html>. That is what keeps the pre-paint script
// (public/theme-init.js, which cannot import anything) and the app agreeing about the same values:
// they agree on a KEY NAME and a CLASS NAME, and neither carries a font list. `design.test.ts`
// reads both files and fails when they drift.
//
// STORE SHAPE is lib/zen.ts / lib/haptics.ts: module state, a listener set, and a
// useSyncExternalStore hook — no context, no provider, no prop drilling to a settings card.
