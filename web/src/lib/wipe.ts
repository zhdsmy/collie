// ── ONE WIPE ROUTINE FOR THE PHONE (M46 spec 02) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every event that ends a pairing calls `wipeDevice`, and nothing else clears pairing state. Before
// this module each path cleared what it remembered: unpair dropped the token and left the drafts, the
// last-seen pane text, the push subscription and the caches behind. One routine means a new kind of
// stored data gets one cleaner here (or registers one with `onWipe`), and every path picks it up.
//
// The reasons, and who calls them:
//
//   - `unpair`   the operator revoked THIS device from Settings (components/paired-devices.tsx).
//   - `revoked`  the bridge answered 403 `device not paired` while this phone held a token: someone
//                revoked it from another device, or the registry it was minted in is gone.
//   - `expired`  the bridge answered 403 `device expired` (M46 spec 01).
//   - `password` a pane sits at a password prompt (ADR 0017). Not the end of a pairing, so it takes a
//                scope: the session text of that one pane, its draft and its stored records, and
//                never the token. ADR 0017 decides that scope; this routine only carries it.
//
// The first three clear, in this order: the device token, every draft, the push subscription (with
// the remembered endpoint), Cache Storage except the app shell, and then whatever registered itself
// with `onWipe`. The on-device store (lib/store.ts, ADR 0087) is one of those: it holds the last-seen
// snapshot and pane text, and its cleaner deletes the whole database. It registers itself rather
// than being listed here because it imports this module, and a cycle would leave one of the two
// half-loaded.
//
// WHAT STAYS, ON PURPOSE. Preferences: theme, design, display and dash prefs, pins, hidden machines,
// haptics, zen, the tour flag, the push-disabled choice, per-pane mirror inversion. They hold no
// session content, only how this phone likes to look, and a re-paired phone should look the same.
// The workbox precache stays too, because the app shell must still open offline to show the pair
// form. lib/storage-keys.test.ts holds the full list and fails on a key that is in neither.
//
// ONE REFUSAL IS NOT ENOUGH TO WIPE. A 403 with one of the two exact bodies, while a token is held,
// first asks the bridge once more: one GET of `/api/devices` with the same token. Only when that
// answer is ALSO a 403 with one of the two exact bodies does the wipe run. Any other answer (a 200,
// the 503 `pairing unavailable` a corrupt registry gives, a network error, another 403 text) latches
// the refusal for the pair affordances and wipes nothing: a bridge that answered oddly once must not
// cost the operator their drafts.
//
// A WIPE IS RESUMABLE. It writes `collie:wipe-pending` (the reason) first, runs the cleaners, and
// clears the flag last. A page killed half way leaves the flag, and the next boot runs the wipe again
// before anything reads storage (lib/wipe-resume.ts, the first import of main.tsx). It also writes
// `collie:wipe-last`, the reason the pair screen names once and then clears. Before the cleaners run
// it posts on the `collie-wipe` BroadcastChannel, so another open tab closes its store connection
// and the database delete is not blocked by it (lib/store.ts listens).
