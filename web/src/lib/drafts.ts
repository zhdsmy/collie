// first place) unmounted the composer and ate the draft. This is the tiny store that keeps it.
//
// **localStorage, not sessionStorage.** A phone PWA gets killed mid-composition by the OS all the
// time — backgrounded, memory pressure, screen off long enough — and sessionStorage dies with the
// page. The draft has to outlive the process, not just the navigation.
//
// Same storage-guard style as lib/haptics.ts: every access is behind a `typeof localStorage` check
// AND a try/catch, because Safari private mode throws on setItem rather than reporting quota. A
// draft is never important enough to break a render or a send.

 * a pane switch remounts the composer — this is what it remounts from.
 *
 * IT IS COVERED BY ADR 0017 ONLY BECAUSE EVERY WRITE AND CLEAR GOES THROUGH `saveDraft` /
 * `clearDraft`. The password-prompt gates live upstream of both (composer.tsx's `noEchoRef` guards
 * the keystroke write-through and the pane-leave save; the recognising outcome calls `clearDraft`),
 * so a recognised prompt reaches neither tier and purges both in the same tick. A cache written from
 * anywhere else — component state, a second module — would re-open #103 in RAM, where nothing is
 * gating it. Don't add one.
 *
 * No age prune, deliberately: `MAX_AGE_MS` exists because localStorage outlives the process and an
 * ancient half-thought resurfacing is jarring. A entry here cannot be older than this page session,
 * which is exactly how long the composer would have held it had it never unmounted.
