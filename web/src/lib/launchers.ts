// `/api/config` cache. Rows must come from the host that RUNS them: a crew peer keeps its own
// `launchers.toml`, and the lead's single startup fetch can only ever answer for itself. So this
// reads `GET /api/launchers` (session-scoped, forwarded on `?host=` — server.ts) fresh on every
// mount and whenever `scope` changes, rather than once per page load — the file is read live on the
// bridge behind an mtime check, so a fresh look is what "live" is supposed to buy the operator.
//
// A FAILED FETCH IS NOT AN ERROR STATE, on the same terms lib/operator-config.ts's read is: this
// leaves the rows exactly as they were (empty on a first failed mount) and any later mount — the
// switcher sheet reopened, the dashboard revisited — tries again.
