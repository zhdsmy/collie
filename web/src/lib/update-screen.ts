// ── UPDATE MODE, AS ONE PURE READING ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A running update puts the phone into update mode (ADR 0064, amending ADR 0044): the app stays in
// view behind a veil and does not take a tap, a band across the top says "Update mode, step N of 7"
// with a clock and doubles as the progress bar, and a panel docked at the bottom walks seven steps:
// Check, Build, Restart, Verify, Other machines, This phone, Done. One row per machine, one for this
// phone. WHICH of that the operator sees is decided here and nowhere else, so the precedence is
// pinned by a table (`update-screen.test.ts`) rather than by pulling a DOM apart.
//
// WHY ONE READING, and not three: `.adr/0044`, which carries the dated incidents three readers of one
// run produced. That rule stands. What 0064 changes is what the one reading says.
//
// ── THE MODE ENDS IN THREE PLACES, AND NEVER ON A TOAST ─────────────────────
// Done, Rolled back and Stuck (a run that stopped reads as Stuck's sibling, "stopped", and so does a
// run this device started that gave up before anything moved, "failed"). Each is a
// screen with "Back to the app", and the app stays locked until the phone's own step is over. The
// old sheet closed itself the moment the lead said `done` while the members still waited, and fired
// "Crew updated" over them: the lead's run is not the update. So `done` on the lead is step 5 while a
// member still moves, step 6 while this phone fetches the new app, and step 7 only after that.
//
// ── THE PHONE IS THE LAST STEP, AND IT RELOADS ONCE ─────────────────────────
// The device that started the run saves its own reload for step 6: `holdsReload` is true until then,
// the hook holds the reload guard on it, and `lib/pwa.ts` pauses its worker check and defers a
// controller swap while it is held. The page that boots after the reload finds the claim this device
// wrote (`lib/update-ribbon.ts`) and reopens here, at step 7, before its first paint.
//
// ── ONLY THE ACTIVE ROW MOVES ───────────────────────────────────────────────
// A row is one of seven statuses. `active` draws the one spinner; `queued` is a still, dimmed circle.
// Every waiting row used to spin, which said "everything is happening" about a queue that moves one
// machine at a time.
//
// ── DISMISSIBILITY IS STILL ONE SENTENCE ────────────────────────────────────
// The app is locked while a run THIS DEVICE STARTED is in flight and the operator has not taken the
// way out a stall offers. `dismissible` is the negation of `locked`, taken here and never re-derived.

// ── EVERY THRESHOLD IS A CONSTANT IN THIS FILE, WITH ITS REASON AT THE LINE ──
