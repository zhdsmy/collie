// The startup-resolved half of /api/config, read ONCE and held in module state: the operator's own
// rows (their `commands.toml` palette, their `keys.toml` tray presets and their
// `quick-replies.toml` dock groups) and the multiplexer's declared
// capabilities (M10/06). They all ride the same request because they are the same kind of thing —
// config the bridge resolves at startup and the client reads once.
//
// THE CAPABILITIES BELONG HERE RATHER THAN IN A SECOND STORE for the reason the header already
// gives: this is ONE /api/config call, never a second channel. A capability store with its own
// fetch would double the request and could disagree with this one about what the same response
// said. lib/mux-capability.ts holds the POLICY (what an absent answer means, which control asks
// what); this file holds only the bytes.
//
// Modelled on the lib/server-build.ts store idiom: plain module state + subscribe + a
// useSyncExternalStore hook, so the composer participates without prop-drilling through the route
// tree.
//
// THE CONTRACT: one SUCCESSFUL read is cached for the life of the page; a failed attempt is not
// cached, so a later mount tries again. Never polled, and deliberately not folded into the 1.5s
// snapshot: this is startup config on the bridge side (loadConfig() runs once, bridge/index.ts), so
// re-reading it every tick would spend bytes on a value that cannot change without a bridge
// restart. Which is also why changing it takes a bridge restart AND a page load, not just the
// restart — the same contract every other COLLIE_* var has, and what `.env.example` promises.
//
// A FAILED FETCH IS NOT AN ERROR STATE. With no rows, every pane falls back to its shipped catalog,
// which is exactly what a user without this var already sees. So a refusal (read-only
// device, auth lapse) or an offline start leaves an empty list and no status noise, and the single
// in-flight promise is cleared so a later MOUNT retries. Retry granularity is the reason the kick
// below lives in an effect and not in the render body: the composer re-renders on every 1.5s
// snapshot, so a render-phase kick would turn one refusal into a request per tick, forever.

 * The second is the subscription: `--font-operator-family` has to be rewritten when the reader moves

 * module does, so the wiring lives here. Called once from main.tsx, after `initDesign`.
