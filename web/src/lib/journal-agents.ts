// WHICH AGENTS CAN HAVE A READABLE TRANSCRIPT AT ALL — the client's half of the question
// `bridge/journal/registry.ts` answers server-side.
//
// The bridge sets `AgentView.hasSession` when the agent has a journal adapter and a session is
// addressable — reported on the pane record, or found by an adapter that discovers its own
// (`bridge/types.ts` toPaneWire). Both halves are folded into that one flag, so an absent flag
// cannot say WHICH half failed — and the two want opposite words. An agent with no journal adapter
// has nothing to explain: there is no transcript to read, ever, and a sentence about it would be
// noise. An agent that HAS one and still reported no session is the case an operator can fix
// (issue #137: a missing or outdated `herdr integration install <agent>` hook), and silence there
// reads as a bug in Collie. A discovering adapter (Muse) never lands here: its panes always offer
// the affordance, since no hook could fix what discovery already finds.
//
// So the frontend needs the name list, and it is a NAME LIST, never a detector: nothing may key a
// grammar, a fetch or a pane's identity off a match against `JOURNAL_AGENT_NAMES` — the same rule
// `KNOWN_HARNESS_NAMES` carries bridge-side. It decides one muted sentence and nothing else.
//
// The two smaller sets below are declared per-agent FACTS, each mirrored from its own constant in
// `bridge/journal/registry.ts` with the reason there. `FIRST_PROMPT_AGENTS` words a note.
// `OFF_GRID_IMAGE_AGENTS` bounds one read: the newest turn's picture after a finished turn (#292).
// It decides whether that read is worth making, never what a screen means.
//
// This is NOT `lib/harness/registry.ts`, and the two must not be folded together — that one owns
// block grammars for the LIVE MIRROR (claude, codex, grok, omp, agy), this one owns reading an
// on-disk log (claude, codex, grok, hermes, muse, opencode, pi). A harness can plausibly have
// either without the other, which is exactly why the bridge keeps two registries too.
//
// Kept in step with `bridge/journal/registry.ts` by hand, deliberately: the list is not on the wire
// (no bridge publishes it), and a speculative fetch to discover it would cost a request per pane to
// answer a question about a sentence. Adding a journal adapter there means adding its name here.
