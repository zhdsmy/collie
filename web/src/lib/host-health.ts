// TIER 2 of the two-tier connection model: lead↔peer. A pure derivation from the snapshot's
// `servers[]` to a per-host presentation state. No timers, no listeners, no module-mutable state,
// no `useSyncExternalStore` — call it, get an answer, throw it away.
//
// ── WHY THIS IS NOT IN lib/connection-health.ts ──────────────────────────────
// That module is TIER 1, phone↔lead, and it is deliberately ONE module-scoped clock: three
// variables, five mutators, one latch. Its header comment records why (escalation used to live in a
// per-component ref/timer, two instances diverged, and the banner went red while the header pill sat
// amber). Giving it a host dimension — a map of anchors, a `markLive(host)`, N latches — would
// re-create that exact divergence by construction, once per crew member. So the seam is structural,
// not a matter of discipline: tier 2 lives HERE, gains no clock, and tier 1 gains no host argument.
// `grep -n "reachable\|host" lib/connection-health.ts` is empty and host-health.test.ts keeps it so.
//
// The two tiers compose by SUBORDINATION, never by mixing:
//   - The lead being unreachable is tier 1's answer and it covers everything (the ConnectionBanner,
//     the dog, the polling pause, the offline navigation fast path). Nothing here participates.
//   - A peer being unreachable is tier 2's answer and it degrades only that host's rows and panes.
//     It never feeds `isConnecting`, never reaches `latchLost()`, never pauses a poll: a snapshot
//     the lead served while a peer was down is a LIVE poll, and `api.ts` stamps it as one.
//
// ── AND WHY THE CLOCK HERE IS THE LEAD'S, NOT THE BROWSER'S ──────────────────
// `ServerSummary.lastSeenAt` is stamped by the LEAD on receipt (CREW_PROTOCOL.md §10.2 — "a peer's
// clock is never trusted"), so the only sound thing to measure it against is the lead's clock too:
// the snapshot's own `ts`. Subtracting a phone's `Date.now()` from a lead's timestamp measures the
// skew between two machines as much as it measures staleness — on a phone a few minutes fast, every
// peer in the crew would read stale forever; a few minutes slow, none ever would.
//
// The freshness of the SNAPSHOT itself is a different question with a different clock (the browser's)
// and it already has an owner: tier 1. That is the whole orthogonality — tier 1 asks "how old is
// what I'm holding", tier 2 asks "how old was the peer data when the lead assembled it".
//
// ── AND WHY THE PHONE DOES NOT COUNT ITS OWN SUCCESSFUL FETCH AS A RECEIPT ───
// Considered and declined. "This pane's fetch just came back, so its host answered" is the strongest
// freshness fact the phone has — but consuming it here would mean a per-host anchor that survives
// between calls, i.e. exactly the map-of-clocks this module's header opens by refusing, once per crew
// member. It would also be measured on the BROWSER's clock and then compared against `lastSeenAt`,
// which is the lead's — the cross-machine subtraction two paragraphs up rules out.
//
// It is also redundant now: the same fetch already refreshes the receipt at its source. The lead folds
// every landed forward into `lastSeenAt` (`bridge/crew/registry.ts` → `recordExchange`), so a pane the
// phone is watching produces one receipt per poll, on the lead's own clock, and arrives here through
// the snapshot like every other crew fact. Two implementations of the same idea, one of which needs a
// clock — so this side keeps none.
//
// Consequence worth naming: with polling paused (the idle lock, ADR 0007) `ts` freezes along with
// `lastSeenAt`, so ages stop advancing rather than drifting into a false alarm. That is safe because
// the lock COVERS the screen and its release refetches before uncovering (`beginCatchUp` in
// hooks/use-polling.ts) — nobody ever reads a paused tier-2 state.

/**
 * Three states and no more (CREW_PROTOCOL.md §10.2's table, read as presentation):
 *
 * - `live` — the lead's last poll of this member landed inside the tolerance below.
 * - `stale` — the lead has not heard from it recently enough, and we still hold its last-good
 *   content. Its rows and panes STAY, labelled: a triage list that flickers is worse than one that
 *   is honestly stale, and the blocked agent you opened the app for is exactly the one on the
 *   machine that just went quiet.
 *
 *   **`stale` is a statement about the RECEIPT, never about reachability, and a surface that spells
 *   it "unreachable" is lying.** The lead can hold `reachable: true` beside an old receipt (a sweep
 *   running slower than this phone polls, a slow-link note — §10.2, §10.4), and in that state writes
 *   are NOT refused: {@link writeRefusal} gates on {@link HostHealth.writable}, which is the lead's
 *   plain boolean. So the word "unreachable" and any claim that "replies and keys are refused"
 *   belong to `!writable`, and only to it — see components/host-stale-banner.tsx for the table.
 * - `unknown` — not reachable and never seen at all (`lastSeenAt === 0`): a first visit during an
 *   outage. There is no last-good content to show, so the UI must say so rather than spin forever.
 *
 * Incompatible is deliberately NOT a fourth state — it is a separate axis ({@link HostHealth.incompatible}),
 * because it answers "why", not "what do I render". A member speaking another protocol still has
 * last-good content or doesn't, exactly like an unreachable one.

 * so a perfectly healthy peer's receipt aged 0 → 12 s and read stale for most of every sweep — the
 * banner flapped on a machine that was answering every single request.
 *
 * What fixed it is on the lead, not here: `CrewRegistry.recordExchange` folds every **landed
 * proxied forward** into `lastSeenAt`, so a peer the phone is actually watching gets a receipt per
 * pane read — i.e. at `pollMs` — and the sweep stays the floor for a peer nobody is looking at. The
