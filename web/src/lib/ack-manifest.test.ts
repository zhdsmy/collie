// The anti-rot guard for lib/ack-manifest.ts. It reads api.ts AS SOURCE — never by importing it —
// for the same reason components/collie-mark-hash.test.ts does: the property being asserted is a
// fact about the FILE (which exports it declares, how they are written), and a module object cannot
// tell a POST wrapper from a GET one at runtime.
//
// ── WHAT THE EXTRACTION KEYS ON ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Two keys, both textual, both narrow on purpose:
//
//   1. The source is cut into chunks at every top-level `export` (a line STARTING with `export`).
//      A chunk's name is read from `export [async] function <name>` or `export const <name>`;
//      `export type` / `export interface` / re-exports have no name to take and are dropped.
//   2. A chunk is MUTATING iff its text contains the literal `method: "POST"` (or PUT/PATCH/DELETE).
//      That is the one spelling every mutating call in api.ts uses today, whether it goes through
//      `req` (the JSON transport) or straight to `apiFetch` (the multipart upload, the raw-audio
//      STT post) — so it catches both without knowing which helper was used.
//
// ── WHAT WOULD SLIP PAST IT, STATED SO NOBODY DISCOVERS IT THE HARD WAY ─────────────────────────
//
//   • A method that is not a literal at the call: `method: verb`, `method`, `...init`, or a new
//     transport helper that hardcodes POST once and is passed a path. Each is invisible here.
//   • A mutation exported from some OTHER module and re-exported through api.ts — the chunk carries
//     no method literal, only a name.
//   • A GET that mutates on the bridge's side. `refreshNow` is the near miss in the other direction:
//     it POSTs and is in the manifest, while the bridge gates it as a read (ADR 0031).
//   • Indentation: a top-level export is assumed to start at column 0. Everything in api.ts does.
//
// The false-positive direction is bounded but real: a non-exported helper containing the literal,
// placed between two exports, is attributed to the chunk above it. Chunking at EVERY top-level
// export (not only functions) is what keeps that window one declaration wide.
//
// None of that is a hole to be plugged with a cleverer regex — a regex cannot know a bridge route's
// semantics any more than scripts/check-pack-wire.sh can know a protocol change's (ADR 0025). It is
// the reason the manifest's `why` lines are written by a person and read in review. What the guard
// buys is that the ORDINARY way of adding a mutation to this file cannot be done without answering
// the question, and that is the way every one of the seventeen present today was added.

// VERIFIED TO FAIL IN BOTH DIRECTIONS (DESIGN.md §9), which is what makes this a guard rather than a
// comment: adding `export function pokeThing() { return req("/api/poke", { method: "POST" }) }` to
// api.ts fails with `+ "pokeThing"`, and deleting the `focusPane` entry from the manifest fails with
// the same name from the other side.
