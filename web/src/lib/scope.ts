// The addressing scope: WHICH machine, and WHICH named session on it. Every read and every write in
// the app is scoped by this pair, and it is the one place the two params are composed into a string.
//
// Two dimensions, same shape, one level apart:
//   - session — Herdr can run several named sessions on one machine (each its own server/socket).
//     Travels as `?s=<name>` in the browser URL, `session=<name>` on the wire.
//   - host    — a crew can span several machines; the phone talks only to the lead, which merges its
//     peers. Travels as `?h=<member-id>` in the browser URL, `host=<member-id>` on the wire.
//
// **Absent means "today".** A blank/absent `s` is the primary session; a blank/absent `h` is the lead
// — the collie the phone is actually connected to. So a crew of one machine (solo, i.e. every install
// that exists today) emits NO `?h=` anywhere: every bookmark, deep link, notification payload and
// service-worker-cached navigation keeps resolving byte-identically. That is the whole
// backward-compatibility story, and it is achieved by normalisation, not by branching.
//
// **This module is deliberately react-free.** lib/session.ts owns the hooks (and therefore the
// react-router import) and re-exports everything here; the service worker (src/sw.ts) cannot import
// anything that pulls in react, and it needs to build these exact strings. It no longer builds them
// by hand: it reaches them through lib/push-decision's notificationPath, so the URL it compares is
// byte-identical to the one the router produces for the same scope.
//
// A client-supplied host is only ever a REGISTRY KEY on the lead — it selects among members the
// trust store already holds. It never becomes a path, and never an address the lead dials. Same rule
// the session name has always carried, for the same reason.

 * The browser URL query key that WIDENS the home view to every Herdr session on ONE machine
 * (`?all=1`). Absent, and anything other than `1`, means "no".
 *
 * WHICH machine: the one `?h=` names, and the lead when it names none. The two params compose —
 * `?h=` says which machine and this says how much of that machine. `/api/snapshot` reads the
 * resolved host together with `sessions=all`: no host widens the lead's own registry, and a member
 * widens that member's rows out of the lead's cache, which the lead's sweep keeps widened for
 * exactly this (`bridge/crew/merge.ts` narrows it back for every request that did not ask).
 *
 * A machine that is not in the crew widens nothing. A widened view is a statement about panes only:
 * the space and tab navigators stay the addressed session's, one dimension down from a crew, where
 * the same is already true of every peer.
 *
 * IT IS DELIBERATELY NOT PART OF {@link Scope}, and that is the load-bearing decision in this
 * feature. A scope is an ADDRESS — it says which pane a read or a write lands on, and it is threaded
 * into every pane URL and every cache key. Widening is a statement about how much of one machine the
 * HOME list shows. Folding it into the address would carry it onto pane URLs, into `paneScopeKey`,
 * and into the interning table, where it would mean nothing and split every cache entry in two.
 *
 * So it travels beside a scope and never inside one: {@link scopeSearch} appends it when asked, and
 * `paneScope` (lib/hosts.ts) never sees it, which is what guarantees a row opened from the widened
 * list produces the same URL it would have produced from the narrow one.
