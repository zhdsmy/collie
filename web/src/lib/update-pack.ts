// disagree, because one outranks the other by rule: while a run is in flight the peer's own LEG
// (M16/04) is the fresher fact, and the moment there is no leg the census row (M16/03) is what is
// left. Both are optional on the wire — a solo install and an older bridge send neither, and the
// answer there is an empty list, which is the same screen with no rows on it.
//
// Nothing here decides anything about the pack. It reads what the lead reported and puts the row
// that needs a look at the top.
