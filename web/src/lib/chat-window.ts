// What the phone HOLDS of one live session, and the single pure function that moves it.
//
// ── WHY A REDUCER, AND WHY IT IS NOT A HOOK ──────────────────────────────────
// The hard part of reading `GET /api/pane/:id/chat` is not the fetch. It is the merge: an answer is
// a delta over a numbering, and getting it wrong draws one turn twice or moves a turn that never
// moved. A merge with no DOM, no fetch and no clock can be tested a hundred ways, so this module is
// exactly that, and the cadence stays where it already lives (hooks/use-polling.ts). Nothing here
// imports React and nothing here reads a clock — that is a rule, not an accident.
//
// ── THE THREE RULES, AND THEY ARE THE WHOLE MODULE (ADR 0073) ────────────────
//  1. A `gen` different from the one held REPLACES everything. Two numberings cannot be merged, and
//     pretending otherwise is how a thread ends up showing one turn twice.
//  2. An upsert whose `uuid` is held overwrites IN PLACE and keeps the `seq` it already had, never
//     the `seq` in the answer. A turn that changed did not move. This is not a nicety: opencode
//     re-emits a whole streaming reply under a `uuid` already held, and a `?before=` page and a live
//     page can both carry the same turn.
//  3. An upsert whose `uuid` is new goes in AT ITS OWN `seq`. `?before=` numbers DOWNWARD, and an
//     incremental answer can carry a turn that sits below what the client holds (a tool result edits
//     a turn that went out long ago), so insertion may never assume append.
//
// ── AND THE TWO EMPTY ANSWERS ARE DIFFERENT FACTS ────────────────────────────
// `available: false` is "this pane has no session to show". A 404 is "this machine is a release
// behind" — the route is additive-optional over a crew link (ADR 0073 point 7). A client that draws
// them alike tells an operator to wait for something that will never arrive, so they are two kinds
// of {@link ChatStatus} and never one.
