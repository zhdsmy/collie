// Chrome stripping — trims the agent's own TUI chrome off the TAIL of a parsed buffer so the app's
// composer/statusline supersedes it instead of duplicating it. Today that's the Claude Code input
// box (the "❯ …" prompt line sandwiched between two rules) plus the statusline / hint lines below it
// and any trailing blank runs.
//
// Deliberately CONSERVATIVE: it strips only when the WHOLE input-box frame matches confidently at
// the tail, never removes content above it, and leaves rows below the box it cannot name on the
// mirror — when unsure it returns the buffer untouched (the T1 raw-mirror fallback). Pure; operates on parsed line text, so a user-configured statusline is
// matched by POSITION (below the box's bottom border), never by its content strings.

/**
 * GHOST TEXT — the generated "suggested next prompt" a newer Claude Code paints inside an otherwise
 * empty input box (a whole plausible message: "fix it", "run the tests", …). It is NOT a draft: it is
 * a suggestion the operator has not written and, until they act on it, the box is empty.
 *
 * Content cannot tell the two apart — the suggestion is arbitrary generated prose and changes every
 * turn, so INPUT_PLACEHOLDERS (which knows one fixed literal) can never grow to cover it. STYLE can.
 * Measured on a live Claude Code v2.1.235 pane through the bridge (2026-08-19): the prompt line comes
 * over the wire as
 *
 *     ❯ \x1b[0m\x1b[2mfix it\x1b[0m
 *
 * — the suggestion is a run of SGR 2 (faint) with no colour of its own, while the "❯" marker and every
 * real draft on the same line carry no SGR at all (`dim: false`). Typing replaces the suggestion
 * outright, so a box never holds both at once; that is what makes "EVERY visible run is faint" sound
 * as the whole-box test rather than a per-run one.
 *
 * Three consequences follow from misreading one as a draft, and all three are fixed by classifying it
 * here, at the single place a draft is derived (lib/reply-action.ts and composer.tsx both take their
 * draft from `extractInputDraft`, so neither needs its own ghost test):
 *
 *  1. the app offered to "recover" a stranded draft the operator never wrote;
 *  2. the composer's pre-clear sweep fired `ctrl+k` + a burst of Backspaces at it — and the ghost is
 *     not editable text, so it clears NOTHING (verified live: after a full sweep the same faint run is
 *     still on the line). Destructive keys, no effect, every send;
 *  3. worst, it could VOUCH FOR A SEND THAT NEVER LANDED. `draftCarriesSend` accepts a draft whose
 *     visible characters appear contiguously in the sent text, so a suggestion that happens to be an
 *     8-character substring of the message ("fix the parser…" vs a ghost "fix the ") would satisfy the
 *     guard against a box our text never reached — Collie then fires the submit key and reports
 *     `sent`, and the message is lost. Returning null here keeps a ghost out of that comparison
 *     entirely, which is the defense in depth: the guard never sees a ghost to be fooled by.
 *
 * A false POSITIVE is survivable in the one direction that matters: if a genuine draft were ever
 * painted faint we would neither preview nor sweep it, `pane.send_text` would append to it, and the
 * appended line would then fail `draftCarriesSend` — the send stalls with nothing submitted, which is
 * this module's designed failure mode. A false NEGATIVE (treating a ghost as a draft) is the bug above.
 *
 * `hasInputBox`/`composerReady` deliberately do NOT consult this: a box holding ghost text is a real,
 * typeable box, and refusing to type into it would break every send after the first turn.

 *     shared MAX_DRAFT_LINES budget.
 *  3. THE TAIL IS ACCOUNTED FOR (classifyTail): a statusline run, a completion popup, or `unknown`.

 *     a numbered option or a "<key> to <verb>" hint (tailNamesAMenu); an `unknown` tail may also carry
 *     no pointer glyph, rule or stepper header (tailLooksModal). An echoed box higher up with a live
 *     dialog below it is refused when the dialog paints one of those marks in the tail, or a grammar
 *     claims it. A dialog with none of them under a stale box is not refused (ADR 0048).
 *
 * Why the frame and not the old bottom-up walk: that walk had to CROSS the tail to reach the border,
 * with a row budget (MAX_STATUS_LINES), so anything below the box it could not name (a completion
 * popup whose command names Claude clipped with "…", say) hid a live box and stalled every send.
 * The budget still bounds what the VIEW strips as a statusline; it no longer decides whether the box
 * exists (ADR 0048, amending ADR 0004).
 *
 * The generic menu grammar (menu.ts) cannot run here, because it asks this function first. What it
 * claims is covered by its footer instead: the grammar claims a screen only when a footer row names
 * keys, and tailNamesAMenu refuses that row in a `statusline` or `unknown` tail. Its rule under the
 * region's top adds a second refusal: step 1 stops there when the rule is a bare border, and
 * tailLooksModal refuses any other rule in an `unknown` tail (a `statusline` tail is exempt from it).
 * A popup tail is not checked, but a popup is only named under a slash-command draft.
