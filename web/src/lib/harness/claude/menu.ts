// The GENERIC menu grammar — the LAST-RESORT detector for a modal screen no specific grammar owns.
//
// Claude Code paints a growing family of full-screen pickers (`/model`, and whatever ships next)
// that are not AskUserQuestion dialogs: they have no numbered-menu recipe, no `Enter to select`
// footer, and — the part that bit us — no input box at the tail. Before this grammar existed, none
// of the specific detectors claimed the `/model` picker, so Collie showed no buttons, `dialogPresent`
// stayed false, and a composer send typed the user's message straight INTO the picker.
//
// What makes a generic claim safe is that the screen NAMES ITS OWN KEYS: the footer is a
// `·`-separated list of "<key> to <verb>" hints ("Enter to set as default · s to use this session
// only · Esc to cancel"). We up-level exactly those hints into buttons, plus the arrow navigation the
// region advertises. We invent nothing.
//
// DIGITS ARE NEVER SYNTHESISED (.adr/0009). Live-probed 2026-08-05: pressing a digit in the `/model`
// picker confirms instantly AND writes the choice to the user's default for new sessions. A digit is
// therefore an unrecoverable, unprompted-for side effect on a screen whose semantics we do not know —
// so this grammar only ever emits keys the screen itself printed, plus the arrows that move a
// highlight.
//
// Pure functions over `StyledLine[]`, tail-anchored exactly like prompt-select.ts: the footer must be
// the LAST non-blank line, so a picker that has scrolled up simply doesn't match.
//
// THIS FILE IS THE REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GENERIC MODAL CONTRACT, not its definition. The
// model (../menu-model.ts) and the harness-agnostic derivation — footer-hint parsing, the key
// whitelist, label capitalisation, the arrow-row grammar and key constants (../menu-hints.ts) — are
// shared, so another adapter implements menus by supplying its OWN conventions only: where its region
// starts (Claude: the nearest rule/border above the footer), what its tail is, and how it knows an
// input box is on screen (Claude: ./chrome). See HARNESS_CONTRIBUTING.md → "Menus (generic modals)".

 *   2. `classifyFooter` must NOT claim it — the known dialog families keep their own grammars, which
 *      encode verified keystroke recipes this one cannot reproduce;
 *   3. there must be NO input box at the tail — a normal prompt screen whose statusline happens to
 *      read like hints is not a modal, and claiming it would put fake buttons under a live composer;
 *   4. a full-width rule / box border must sit within REGION_SCAN_WINDOW above the footer, and carry
 *      a non-blank title line under it.

 * Pure; the caller owns pane access.
