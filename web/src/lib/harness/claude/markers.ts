 * Deliberately DECOUPLED from `isHorizontalRule` above, which stays generic on purpose — menu.ts and
 * the select detectors need its wider box-drawing/block-eighth/dash family to recognise a dialog's own
 * rules. That generality is exactly what made an earlier version of THIS function unsafe: reusing
 * isHorizontalRule here meant a spaced-out prose separator like "— — —" (isHorizontalRule strips ALL
 * interior whitespace before testing, so it compacts to "———" and passes) or a `│ │ │` table divider
 * would both read as an input-box border — letting a stray prose or table line pair up with an
 * unrelated `❯` line elsewhere on screen to complete the FULL bottom-border → ❯ → top-border shape
 * `locateInputBox` looks for, defeating that structural guard from the inside instead of being caught
 * by it. Restricting to the single glyph Claude actually uses closes that hole. A dialog border with
 * corner glyphs (`╭────╮`) is deliberately NOT an input-box border either — Claude never draws its
 * input box that way, only its outer chrome/dialogs do, and conflating the two is the same class of
 * mistake.
 *
 * This is layer one of two: the real protection is still structural, not lexical. `locateInputBox`
 * (chrome.ts) only trusts a border when the full bottom-border → ❯ → top-border shape lines up around
 * it (plus the draft-walk cap, MAX_DRAFT_LINES below, bounding how far apart the pieces of that

/**
 * Classify a candidate footer line — the hint bar at the very bottom of a Claude dialog — into a
 * dialog family, or null when it isn't a recognised menu footer. The footer is the single most
 * stable discriminator for three of the four families: Claude Code generates it (unlike the
 * user-configured statusline), and the confirm phrase pins the keystroke recipe:
 *
 *   - "Enter to select …"  → select     (AskUserQuestion: the digit THEN Enter)
 *   - "… Tab to amend …"   → permission (edit/bash "Do you want to proceed?": the digit alone)
 *   - a bare "Esc to cancel" → permission, but only when `namesPermissionDialog` finds the dialog's
 *     own question and Yes/No rows (the hint bar a permission dialog shows off its Yes/No rows)
 *   - "ctrl+g to edit …" or the plan file's path → plan (ExitPlanMode: the digit alone), but only
 *     when `namesPlanDialog` finds the dialog's own question and numbered menu
 *
 * The fourth, `trust` (folder-trust prompt: the digit alone), needs MORE than its footer. Its phrase
 * "Enter to confirm" is ordinary Claude wording that other screens print — the /effort slider prints
 * it — and `menu.ts` reads any family claim as "a specific grammar owns this screen", so a wrong
 * `trust` takes every button off a screen nobody owns (ADR 0053). So the trust arm fires only when
 * `namesTrustDialog(texts)` finds that dialog's own words. Without them the phrase classifies as
 * nothing at all.
 *
 * `texts` is the pane's line texts, and it is REQUIRED: a caller that cannot see the screen cannot
 * be told the trust family, and making it required turns that into a compile error rather than a
 * family that quietly stops being reported.
 *
 * Case-insensitive and anchored only on the confirm phrase, so per-install extra hints
 * (ctrl+e to explain, ↑/↓ to navigate, …) don't disturb the classification.
