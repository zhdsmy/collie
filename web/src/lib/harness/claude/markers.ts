 * rule glyphs and whitespace).
 *
 * Deliberately DECOUPLED from `isHorizontalRule` above, which stays generic on purpose — menu.ts and
 * the select detectors need its wider box-drawing/block-eighth/dash family to recognise a dialog's own
 * rules. That generality is exactly what made an earlier version of THIS function unsafe: reusing
 * isHorizontalRule here meant a spaced-out prose separator like "— — —" (isHorizontalRule strips ALL
 * interior whitespace before testing, so it compacts to "———" and passes) or a `│ │ │` table divider
 * would both read as an input-box border — letting a stray prose or table line pair up with an
 * unrelated `❯` line elsewhere on screen to complete the FULL bottom-border → ❯ → top-border shape
 * `locateInputBox` looks for, defeating that structural guard from the inside instead of being caught
 * by it. Restricting to the single glyph Claude actually uses closes that hole. A dialog border with
 * corner glyphs (`╭────╮`) is deliberately NOT an input-box border either — Claude never draws its
 * input box that way, only its outer chrome/dialogs do, and conflating the two is the same class of
 * mistake.
 *
 * This is layer one of two: the real protection is still structural, not lexical. `locateInputBox`
 * (chrome.ts) only trusts a border when the full bottom-border → ❯ → top-border shape lines up around
 * it (plus the draft-walk cap, MAX_DRAFT_LINES in chrome.ts, bounding how far apart the pieces of that
 * shape may sit), so a lone matching line elsewhere on screen does nothing on its own.

 * the time step (e) runs, the only open question is whether THIS line, sitting immediately above an

 * One renderer shape is deliberately left unhandled: when the label is wide enough to overflow the
 * border width, the renderer's own overflow branch drops the LEFT flank to zero width entirely and
 * the "border" becomes bare label text with only a trailing rule run — there is no flank left on one
 * side to test, so it is lexically indistinguishable from ordinary prose ending in a rule-ish run. That
 * capture simply doesn't match here; `stripChrome` falls back to the raw mirror, which is safe (the
