// The MULTI-SELECT MODEL — the harness-NEUTRAL payload of a `multi-select` Block.
//
// The checkbox form of a question dialog: numbered rows a digit TOGGLES, an advance row the pointer
// must be walked onto, and (optionally) a review screen. Like the preview model it carries TWO
// signatures: `signature` normalises the pointer AND the checkbox glyphs out — it is the identity the
// guard compares while the Submit macro deliberately moves the pointer — and `regionSignature` is the
// literal text a write binds to. Any adapter can produce one; the renderer
// (components/multi-select-block.tsx) and the race guard (lib/multi-select-action.ts →
// lib/dialog-guard.ts) are written against these types alone.
//
// Claude's reference detector is harness/claude/multi-select.ts. Imports nothing but its sibling
// models, so `lib/blocks.ts` can re-export it without a cycle. The identity comparators at the bottom
// are part of the same contract (harness/dialog-contract.ts wires kind → comparator).
