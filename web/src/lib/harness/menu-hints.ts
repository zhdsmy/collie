// The SHARED menu derivation helpers — the harness-agnostic half of the generic modal contract
// (menu-model.ts). Any adapter that wants menu buttons builds its MenuModel with these; only the
// harness-SPECIFIC conventions (where the region starts, what counts as its tail, how the input box
// is detected) belong in the adapter. Claude's reference detector: harness/claude/menu.ts.
//
// The invariants these encode, which the conformance suite (conformance.ts) re-checks against every
// adapter's fixture corpus:
//
//   * ONLY KEYS THE SCREEN NAMED. A menu is claimed on the strength of the screen naming its own
//     keys in a `·`-separated "<key> to <verb>" footer. Every emitted action key comes from that
//     footer; the only keys added are the ARROWS the screen advertised. Nothing is inferred.
//   * NO DIGITS, EVER (.adr/0009). Live-probed in Claude's `/model` picker: a digit confirms AND
//     writes the choice to the user's default for new sessions. A digit is a valid Herdr key, so
//     nothing downstream would reject one — the ban has to live in `menuKeyFor`.
//   * SIGNATURE FRESHNESS. The model carries a byte-signature of its region and every send re-derives
//     and compares it (lib/menu-action.ts). An adapter that returns an empty or constant signature
//     silently disables the race guard.
//   * LAST RESORT. Menu detection runs AFTER every specific grammar the adapter has, and must not
//     claim a screen with a live input box — a normal prompt whose statusline reads like hints is not
//     a modal, and claiming it would put fake buttons under a live composer.
//
// Pure functions over strings; no React, no pane access, no harness imports.
