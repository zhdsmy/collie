# omp `/resume` picker: keystroke recipe

The choreography notes file the Tier-2 bar asks for (`HARNESS_CONTRIBUTING.md`), for the one omp
screen the adapter lifts ([ADR 0076](../../../../../.adr/0076-the-omp-resume-picker-is-lifted-and-every-omp-modal-has-a-way-out.md)).
Grammar: `resume.ts`. Corpus: `omp--menu-resume*.txt` (omp 17.2.12, 2026-08) and
`omp--v18-4-resume*.txt` (omp 18.4.10, 2026-10-02).

## What the screen prints

omp 18.4.10, boxed (the pane here is 109 columns by 59 rows; the box fills it):

```

```

omp 17.x to 18.1, unboxed: the same rows with no box, the title with one leading space, a rule under
it, the pointer in column 0, and the footer `  [Del/⌫ delete · Enter select · Tab all projects · Esc cancel]`
above a bare rule. A session may print **two** rows there instead of three: `omp--menu-resume.txt`
lists one titled session and two untitled ones, which show only the first prompt and the meta row.

Both footers print the commit key (`⏎ select`, `Enter select`) and the way out (`⎋ cancel`,
`Esc cancel`). That is why this is inside ADR 0009's rule, not an exception to it.

## What a tap sends

| Tap | Keys |
|---|---|
| the pointed session | `Enter` |
| a session below the pointer, `n` rows down | `Down` × n, then `Enter` |
| a session above the pointer, `n` rows up | `Up` × n, then `Enter` |
| the card's last row | `Escape` |

The action layer does not send the plan as one batch. It walks, verifies, then commits
([ADR 0080](../../../../../.adr/0080-a-pointed-list-is-walked-verified-then-confirmed.md)): the arrows go
first, bound to the tapped screen, and `Enter` goes only bound to a fresh read that shows the pointer on
the tapped row. A timeout or a drift sends nothing, so a pointer left half-walked is read, never
assumed. No digit anywhere, because the screen printed none. The arrow count is a claim about where the pointer
was, which is why the signature carries the `❯` column verbatim: a pointer moved at the desk between the
render and the tap refuses the tap (ADR 0055 point 6).

The signature also carries every age verbatim, so a tap on a screen whose age ticked is refused at entry
(the trade ADR 0058 records). The CORE signature, which the verify read of a walked tap compares, blanks
two things that a redraw changes without a key: the `❯` column and each session's age token. The token is
the one `readMeta` parsed as the age (`7 minutes ago`, `just now`, a date), replaced by `<age>`; size,
`current`, `✔ done` and the rest of the row stay. In the boxed layout the padding up to the closing `│`
depends on the age's width, so that run collapses to one space on those rows. Without this, a picker
that sat open for a minute answered `changed` to every walked tap (ADR 0080 point 5). The pair
`omp--menu-resume.txt` and `omp--menu-resume-moved.txt` shows it: its ages differ (`1 minute ago` against
`2 minutes ago`) and so does the pointer.

**Twin rows keep their ages.** Two sessions with the same title and the same meta row apart from the age
(same size, marks, folder) are told apart only by the age. If the age were blanked there too, a re-sort
that swapped the twins during the walk would pass identity, and the Enter would resume the other session.
So when two or more sessions are identical in title AND in meta-minus-age, the core signature keeps the
ages of those sessions verbatim, and every other session still gets `<age>`. A tick on a twin row then
makes a walked tap answer `changed`, which is the safe side. Every blank in the core signature is a safety
decision, because it is the only link between the tapped dialog and the committed Enter.

The walk is the shortest path and assumes the pointer does not wrap. A tap on a session that is on
screen never needs a wrap, so this holds for every row the card can offer.

## What the grammar requires, all of it

1. The layout's bottom border is the last non-blank row, one spacer row sits under the footer, and
   the footer is the row above that: boxed `│ [<hints>] │`, or bare `  [<hints>]`.
2. The footer is a hint list whose last segment is a way out (`⎋ cancel` and its five siblings) and
   which names `select`.
3. The layout's title, then its fixed header rows (blank, search row, blank; or blank, rule, blank,
   `>` row, blank), directly above the list.
4. The list: blank-separated groups, each ending in a meta row (an age or a date, then a size, then
   anything),
   three rows each, or two for an untitled session, in both layouts. Nothing else down to
   the footer.
5. Exactly one `❯`.
6. A signature no longer than the bridge accepts as a bound region (32768 characters, mirrored here
   as 32000).

Anything missing returns null and the screen stays raw, with the unread-dialog card over it.

## What is not modelled

`⌦/⌫ delete` and `⇥ all projects` act on the picker, not on a session. `PromptModel` has no field for
footer actions, so they stay off the card; the Keys drawer and the card's Terminal control reach them.
The search box is typed through Type mode. `⇥` toggles the title between `(current folder)` and
`(all projects)`, and the grammar reads either. The state with no session at all (`omp--v18-4-resume-nomatch.txt`)
has nothing to point at and is declined.

## Not proven by the captures

- **Probed live, 2026-10-02 (omp 18.4.10, Herdr, 109 by 59).** Taps on a two-session card, then on an
  eight-session card (five hand-made copies of one session log): seven of eight resumed exactly the
  tapped session in both walk directions, and one did nothing, which is the guard's safe side. The
  card's Cancel and the generic card's `Esc` closed their pickers. Not probed: the pointed row's own
  tap in a long list, a list longer than the pane, and a wider pane. These taps were made with the
  old one-batch plan: the arrows and Enter went in one `send_keys` call and the guard compared the
  screen before it, not between the keys. The walk, verify, commit of
  [ADR 0080](../../../../../.adr/0080-a-pointed-list-is-walked-verified-then-confirmed.md) has not been
  probed live; its residual window is the bridge's own read-to-send gap.
- A session list longer than the pane (a scroll counter, a `↓` marker) has no capture. The grammar
  declines on any unknown row, so such a list stays raw until it is captured.
- The all-projects title in the unboxed layout has no capture and is declined rather than guessed.
- A pane past about 550 columns at 59 rows makes the bound region longer than the bridge accepts (32768
  characters), so the picker declines there. The cap was 8192 until this slice raised it.

## Read from omp 18.4.10's source, not from a capture

These come from the session selector in the published `@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent` 18.4.10 bundle.
None is captured yet; re-capture before relying on them further.

- **The age.** `just now`, `N minute(s) ago`, `N hour(s) ago`, `1 day ago`, `N days ago` up to six
  days, then `toLocaleDateString()` in the process locale (`9/23/2026` in en-US). The grammar accepts a
  date of three numbers joined by `/`, `.` or `-`, so a project with week-old sessions still lifts.
  Other date shapes (`2026. 9. 23.` in ko) decline.
- **An untitled session** prints the first prompt on the pointer row and the meta row under it, two
  rows, in the boxed layout too. Captured: `omp--v18-4-resume-untitled-dated.txt`.
- **The pointer** is the symbol preset's `nav.cursor`: `❯` in `unicode` (the default), a Nerd Font
  glyph in `nerd`, `>` in `ascii`. Only `❯` is read; the other presets decline.
- **A pinned session** carries a pin glyph between the pointer and the title, so it shows in the
  card's label.
- **A list taller than the box** is drawn with an automatic scrollbar. Where its cells land is not
  captured. A scrollbar cell on a row the grammar needs blank declines the screen; one inside a
  session row would ride into that row's label or description.
