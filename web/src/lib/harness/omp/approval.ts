// The omp TOOL-APPROVAL dialog grammar (.adr/0078), the third omp screen this adapter lifts and the
// first whose tap can run something: Approve lets the agent run a shell command or write a file. The
// dialog blocks the agent until a human decides, which is why it is worth a card, and why every
// choice below leans toward declining.
//
// The screen, as omp 18.4.10 draws it (`omp--v18-4-approval-bash.txt`; pi-tui
// `overlays/hook-selector.ts`, the body from `formatApprovalPrompt` in `tools/approval.ts`):
//
//     ╭─ Allow tool: bash ─────────────────────────────────╮     the title, `Allow tool: <tool>`
//     │                                                    │
//     │ Command: echo hello-approval                       │     the body: what is being approved
//     │                                                    │
//     │  ❯ Approve                                         │     the pointed row: pointer, label
//     │    Deny                                            │
//     │                                                    │
//     │ ↑/↓ navigate  ⏎ select  ⎋ cancel                   │     the footer, segments split by two spaces
//     │                                                    │
//     ╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
//
// The body is the dialog's subject and is free text: `Command: <command>` for `bash` (an optional
// `Reason: …` row above it when a config pattern asked for approval), or `Path: <path>`, a row reading
// `Content:` and the file's content for `write`. omp word-wraps every body row to the box, so one long
// command can take several rows, and the box grows with the body (`omp--v18-4-approval-write-long.txt`).
//
// THE TWO PRESETS, each read off its own capture and nothing more. The pointer is the symbol preset's
// `nav.cursor`, and the footer is built from the same install's keycaps, so a screen must match ONE
// preset in both places:
//   * omp 18.4.10, `unicode` (the default): `❯` and `↑/↓ navigate  ⏎ select  ⎋ cancel`
//     (`omp--v18-4-approval-*.txt`);
//   * omp 18.1.17, `nerd`: U+F054 (nf-fa-chevron_right) and `up/down navigate  enter select  esc cancel`
//     (`omp--approval-*.txt`).
// The other pairings decline. omp 18.4's `nerd` preset prints private-use keycaps in its footers (the
// Ask captures of 18.4.4 show U+F0311 and U+F12B7), so a chevron under `⏎`/`⎋` is a pair omp does not
// print; `❯` over the text keycaps (18.1 in `unicode`) may exist but is not captured; the `ascii`
// preset's `>` is the most common glyph in a transcript and is not captured either.
//
// WHAT A TAP SENDS. The footer prints the arrows and Enter, so every key is one the screen named (ADR
// 0009), and no digit is invented. Both buttons are ADR 0055's plain walk from the pointed row,
// `pointerWalk(pointedAt, i)`: `Approve` is `Enter` when the pointer is on it and `Up`, `Enter` when
// it is on Deny; `Deny` is `Enter` when the pointer is on it and `Down`, `Enter` when it is on
// Approve. The action layer splits the plan (ADR 0080): it sends the arrows bound to the tapped
// screen, reads the pointer back, and sends `Enter` only bound to a fresh read that shows the pointer
// on the tapped row. A pointer that moved at the desk makes the tap send nothing, never a different
// choice. omp's list clamps at its ends (`HookSelectorComponent.handleInput` calls
// `MenuSelection.move(delta, false)`; the live Deny-on-Deny probe of 2026-10-02 showed it), and the
// model declares that as `clampedEnds`. That fact is load-bearing again, as a declared fact the
// action layer consumes and not as a plan: the plans above stay the plain walk, and the commit batch
// is the action layer's. `Approve` is the first row and `Deny` the last, so the commit goes out as
// `Up, Enter` and `Enter` is never bare on an edge: a desk arrow landing in the gap between the
// bridge's re-read and its send cannot turn a Deny tap into an approval, nor an Approve tap into a
// denial that the user did not ask for (ADR 0078's guarantee, restored by ADR 0080 point 6).
// `Cancel` sends `Escape` and is no row of the list. The card's last row
// is the footer's way out in its own words (`Cancel`), sending `Escape`, which omp also reports to
// the agent as a denial.
//
// WHAT THE CARD SHOWS, so nobody approves blind. The caption is the title (`Allow tool: bash`, the
// tool's name). The Approve button's description is the body, row by row, rows joined by ` ↵ ` so a
// newline in a command is never read as a space; that overstates a soft wrap as a break, which is the
// safe direction. The `question` (the card's accessible name) is the title and the same rows. Nothing
// is ever shortened or hidden: a bash body is shown whole, and so is a `write` body, up to
// MAX_CONTENT_ROWS rows of content, past which the screen declines to the raw mirror. omp itself
// shortens every field to 2000 characters (`truncateForPrompt`), and a field it shortened declines
// below. The box's title and body also stay in the raw mirror above the card, verbatim.
//
// FAIL CLOSED. Every piece below is required, and any one missing returns null, which leaves the raw
// mirror and the unread-dialog card's Escape exactly as slice 1 drew them:
//   * the bottom border is the last non-blank row. Under the 18.1.17 preset alone it may also be the row
//     above one row of anything (the operator's usage strip, kept out of the signature); the 18.4.10
//     captures carry none, and a box left behind by an exited omp must not read as one;
//   * from the border up: a blank box row, the footer, a blank box row, exactly two option rows, a
//     blank box row. So a third option (`Always for this session`, which omp prints first on its config
//     approvals), a search status row and a clipped footer all decline;
//   * the footer is exactly one preset's, character for character (a `·` between the segments, as the
//     other omp footers print, is another footer), and the options read exactly `Approve` then `Deny`
//     with exactly one carrying that preset's pointer;
//   * every body row opens with the box's left side, the first is not blank, and a blank box row sits
//     under the title. A body row is free text and its right side is not required, as ask.ts reads its
//     question rows: every byte of it binds the tap, and the card shows all of it but the border;
//   * the title is exactly `Allow tool: <name>` with no countdown, and the tool is `bash` or `write`,
//     the two with captured bodies. Their body must have the captured shape (an optional `Reason:` row,
//     then `Command:`; or `Path:`, then a row reading `Content:`);
//   * the body carries neither omp's own elision mark (`[…Nch elided…]`, so omp hid part of the
//     subject from the terminal too) nor a `Provider safety checks:` section (uncaptured), nor a
//     control, zero-width or bidi character, which can make the card read differently from the command;
//   * a region short enough for the bridge to bind (32000 characters, as resume.ts and ask.ts).
//
// Pure functions over `StyledLine[]`, tail-anchored like every other grammar.
