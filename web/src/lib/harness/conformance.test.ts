// The Claude adapter is the reference implementation the conformance suite gates. The fixture
// cohorts are derived from the byte-faithful corpus (web/src/fixtures/panes/claude--*.txt) by

// captures whose block may still be wiring up (a not-yet-detecting own fixture is tolerated by the
// suite, see conformance.ts).
//
// The FOREIGN cohort is the other adapters' corpora (omp + codex + grok). Until a second corpus
// existed this leg was vacuous (`foreignFixtures: []`), so "an adapter must stay raw on another
// harness's screens" was a documented promise nothing checked. The mirror-image assertions live in
// harness/omp.test.ts, harness/codex.test.ts and harness/grok.test.ts.

// The SPLIT shape (#110), both halves captured live on 2026-08-17 in the collie-demo sandbox (pane

// This pair is the whole point of the fix: before it, `draftCarriesSend` said TRUE to both, so the
