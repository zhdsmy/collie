# Codex exec-approval — keystroke recipe

Captured 2026-08-22 on Codex v0.149.0 in a sandbox pane started with
`--ask-for-approval on-request -c approvals_reviewer=user`. Note the config dependency: with
`approvals_reviewer = "auto_review"` (this host's default) eligible approval requests are routed
through a reviewer subagent instead of the user — the observed commands were approved with no
dialog painted. `user` restores the human dialog. The card REPLACES the composer (no `› `
prompt / status row at the tail). Herdr status: `blocked`.

```
  Would you like to run the following command?
  Environment: local
  Reason: Do you want to allow creating /tmp/collie-codex-probe.txt outside the sandbox?
  $ touch /tmp/collie-codex-probe.txt
› 1. Yes, proceed (y)
  2. Yes, and don't ask again for commands that start with `touch /tmp/collie-codex-probe.txt` (p)
  3. No, and tell Codex what to do differently (esc)
  Press enter to confirm or esc to cancel
```

Live-probed, in this session:

| Key | Effect |
|---|---|
| `y` | Confirms **Yes, proceed** immediately (file created). |
| `1` | Same — digits confirm their row directly, no Enter (file created on a second card). |
| `3` | Confirms **No** immediately; the command never ran (file verified absent ON DISK — negative control) and the conversation shows "interrupted — tell the model what to do differently". Rendering quirk: Codex still paints a `• Ran <cmd>` transcript row for the CANCELLED tool call — that row is the attempted call's entry, not execution evidence; the on-disk check is what proved non-execution. |
| `Enter` | Confirms the **highlighted** row (default highlight was row 1). |

Not probed (so not emitted): row 2 / `p` (persists an approval prefix — a mode change), bare
`esc` (row 3's shortcut; digit 3 is the probed reject).

What the adapter emits — the one-shot Yes and the reject only, and only when every row proves
its class: the FIRST row must be `Yes, proceed`, the LAST row must be `No, and tell Codex what
to do differently`, and every row between must match `don't ask again` (persistent — never a
button). Any other row shape refuses the whole card. Digits are consecutive `1..n`; the footer
and the `Would you like to run the following command?` header must both be on screen. The
header, Reason, `$ command`, and persistent "don't ask again" rows stay in the raw mirror
above the buttons, so the operator reads exactly what they are approving and still sees the
persist option even though it is never a button.

Only the exec-command approval is captured; other approval kinds (patch application, MCP
consents, …) have different headers and fail closed until captured and probed.
