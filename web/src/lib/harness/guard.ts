// Nothing here knows a harness OR a block kind — it is deliberately one layer below that. The layer
// that binds the three parameters is lib/dialog-guard.ts: it supplies the detector (the pane's own
// adapter, via the registry) and the comparator (the kind's contract, via harness/dialog-contract),
// and it is the only caller the action modules see. Keeping the mechanism here and the wiring there
// is what lets this file stay free of both the registry and the models.
