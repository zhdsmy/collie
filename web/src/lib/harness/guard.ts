// adapter, via the registry) and the comparator (the kind's contract, via harness/dialog-contract),
// and it is the only caller the action modules see. Keeping the mechanism here and the wiring there
// is what lets this file stay free of both the registry and the models.

 *
 * Why a tap needs this: the read a card revalidates on can land before the TUI repaints, and the
 * card would then keep the OLD highlight until the next idle poll (6 s). The next committing tap
 * compares the full signature of that stale picture with a fresh read and is refused. Awaiting this
 * before `revalidate()` makes the card show the picture the key produced, and the card stays
 * disabled for as long as its `onAction` promise is pending.
 *
 * The bound is time, not a count of sleeps: a read is a `fetchPane` with a 10 s timeout of its own,
 * so a stalled bridge would otherwise hold the cards for about 70 s. The loop checks the deadline
 * before each sleep and before each read, never sleeps past it, and gives each read an abort signal
 * that fires at the deadline. At most one read is in flight. The spacing between reads is
 * SETTLE_DELAYS_MS.
 *
 * The baseline is `args.from`, else the text the client had seen when its latest key was sent (the
 * read the entry guard made, or a choreography's last verified read; see `textBeforeLastSend`), so no
 * extra read is spent on it. With no baseline there is nothing to wait for and it returns at once.
 *
 * Never throws, and a timeout is a normal outcome: a key that changes nothing (Left at the end of a
 * scale) leaves the text as it was. A failed or aborted read counts as an unchanged one. Returns
 * whether a changed read was seen.
 *
 * A settle read refreshes the pane's ETag cache, so the `revalidate()` that follows can come back
 * "not modified" and count as a quiet poll. That is harmless: the burst a tap starts runs at least
 * BURST_MIN_POLLS (5, lib/poll-intent.ts) polls before quiet polls can end it.
