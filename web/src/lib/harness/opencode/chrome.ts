//     ┃                                        <- the composer's top padding
//     ┃  <the draft, wrapped>                  } the draft block: the composer's bar run between its
//     ┃                                        }   top padding and the separator above the model row
//     ┃  Build · GPT-6 Astra Pro OpenRouter …  <- the model row: the last TEXT row inside the bar
//     ┃                                        <- a bare bar row, at 50 columns only (see (b))
//     ╹▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀                            <- the bottom rule
//     <cwd> … ctrl+p commands                  <- status rows (chrome; re-surfaced by the probe)
//
// Every gate is a glyph predicate or an adjacency, and no predicate reads a row's CONTENT except where
