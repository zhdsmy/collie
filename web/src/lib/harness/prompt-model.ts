// The PROMPT-SELECT MODEL — the harness-NEUTRAL payload of a `prompt-select` Block.
//
// A single-choice dialog: a question, a list of options, and the family whose verified keystroke
// recipe each option's `keys` already encodes. Any adapter can produce one; the renderer
// (components/prompt-select-block.tsx) and the race guard (lib/prompt-action.ts → lib/dialog-guard.ts)
// are written against these types alone, never against a harness's internals.
//
// Types + the pure IDENTITY COMPARATOR, no detection and no harness conventions. Claude's reference
// detector is harness/claude/prompt-select.ts. This module imports nothing, so `lib/blocks.ts` can
// re-export it without a cycle.

/** The single-choice dialog families a harness can report, discriminated by its footer hint bar.

 *     will type into on a `plan-change` row: re-entering a non-empty field puts the caret at
 *     position 0, so our text would be PREPENDED to a sentence someone else is mid-way through writing.
