// The WIZARD MODEL — the harness-NEUTRAL payload of a `wizard` Block.
//
// A multi-question dialog driven one keystroke at a time: the stepper chips plus the CURRENT step,
// which is either a question (one digit selects AND advances) or the Submit review. Any adapter can
// produce one; the renderer (components/wizard-block.tsx + wizard-stepper.tsx) and the race guard
// (lib/wizard-action.ts → lib/dialog-guard.ts) are written against these types alone.
//
// Claude's reference detector is harness/claude/wizard.ts; the verified choreography behind the
// incremental round-trip is grammar/WIZARD_NOTES.md. This module imports only the key-plan
// comparator from its sibling prompt model, so `lib/blocks.ts` can re-export it without a cycle. The
// identity comparator below is wired to this kind by dialog-contract.ts.

 * Both carry the stepper chips (per-question answered/current state) and a byte-signature of the
 * on-screen region (stepper header → tail): the full dialog state. The race guard compares it so a
 * wizard that re-rendered between render and tap can't pass as the one the user saw. Herdr's
 * `revision` is a stub, so this content signature is the load-bearing freshness check — it MUST be
 * non-empty and MUST change when the region's text changes.
