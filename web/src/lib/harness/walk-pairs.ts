// THE WALK PAIRS: the corpus proof that a grammar's pointed list survives its own walk (ADR 0080
// point 5, enforced by `describeAdapterConformance` in conformance.ts).
//
// WHY THIS TABLE EXISTS. A tap on a pointed-list row is walked, verified, then committed
// (lib/prompt-action.ts `walkVerifyCommit`): the arrows go out, and Enter goes out only after a fresh
// read is the SAME dialog (`promptsSameIdentity`) with the tapped row now carrying the plan
// ["Enter"]. That is only true if the grammar's `coreSignature` blanks EVERYTHING the pointer's own
// move changes: the `❯` glyph and any text that follows the pointer (a detail pane under the list, a
// description of the highlighted row, a "(n/m)" position counter). One that keeps such text makes
// every walked tap answer `changed` and never commit. The omp `/switch` picker shipped exactly that:
// its two detail rows describe the pointed model. Synthetic perturbations never show it. Only two
// REAL captures of one dialog, the pointer on different rows, do.
//
// HOW IT WORKS. Every fixture an adapter lifts into a `prompt-select` model with at least one walked
// plan (`splitWalk` non-null with arrows) belongs to a GRAMMAR GROUP, keyed `agent | family | title`
// (`walkGroupKey`). The suite then demands, for every such group, one of:
//
//   1. a declared PAIR in {@link WALK_PAIRS}: two captures of the same dialog with the pointer on a
//      different row. The suite asserts `promptsSameIdentity` both ways, not `promptsEqual`, and that
//      the row carrying the plan ["Enter"] (the pointed offered row) differs between the two, so a
//      pair can never be two captures of one pointer position;
//   2. a dated reason in {@link WALK_GAPS}: no such pair exists in the corpus yet. Gaps only shrink:
//      the set of keys is pinned in `conformance.test.ts`, so a new gap is a reviewed decision.
//
// A new fixture whose grammar is in neither fails the suite. The fix is a second capture of the same
// dialog with the pointer on another row, added to {@link WALK_PAIRS}. A pair that fails identity is a
// defect in the grammar's `coreSignature` (blank what follows the pointer), never in the table.
//
// A pair whose two `signature` strings are EQUAL is a pointer drawn only as a style. The suite then also
// requires `styledSignature` on both models, different between the two, and checks it against the raw
// captures with the bridge's own verifier (ADR 0080 point 7).
//
// The group key is the agent, the family and the dialog's own title (the caption, else the first
// question line, cut at the first `:` or ` (`). It needs no per-fixture bookkeeping, it is stable
// across widths and presets of one grammar, and a new grammar lands in a new group by itself.
