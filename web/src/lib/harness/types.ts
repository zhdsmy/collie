// The pluggable detection seam. Each supported agent (claude, codex and omp today; opencode/pi/… tomorrow)
// contributes ONE HarnessAdapter: its own block-building pipeline plus the two chrome re-surfacing
// probes (the statusline the mirror strips, and a stranded input-box draft). The registry
// (registry.ts) maps a Herdr snapshot `agent` string to its adapter; everything not in the registry
// falls back to the universal raw mirror. This is the single decision site the render pipeline and
// agent-chat's status strip both route through, so the "which agents get grammars" policy can't drift.
//
// An adapter is DETECTION only. The Block union + renderers and the keystroke ACTION recipes
// (prompt/wizard/preview-action) stay in core, dispatched from agent-chat — the adapter just tells
// core what's on screen.
