/**
 * Whether a pane's menu may offer "New agent in a worktree", as far as the menu can tell.
 *
 * Two conditions, both required:
 *  - the multiplexer can create a worktree (`createWorktree`, asked of the lead; tmux and zellij
 *    declare it absent);
 *  - the scope is the lead: no `?h=`. The route is lead-local and a crew does not forward it, so a
 *    member's pane must not offer a create the lead would run in the wrong place.
 *
 * The third, that the pane's space sits in a Git repo, is the caller's: it alone holds the snapshot,
 * and it passes no `onBranchOff` for a pane outside one.
