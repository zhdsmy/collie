// The write-through "last seen" cache — what the app re-renders after a COLD boot with no network.
//
// The in-session story was already right: a failed poll keeps the last good data on screen, flagged
// (see lib/loaders.ts). The hole is the one a phone falls into constantly. Switch to the Tailscale
// app, come back, and the mobile browser has DISCARDED the hidden page, or the OS has killed the PWA
// outright: the app boots from zero, its module caches are empty, its first loader fetch fails
// because the tunnel is not up yet, and the screen the operator left behind is simply gone.
//
// So every successful loader fetch also writes its payload here, and a failed fetch with an empty
// module cache reads it back. The router renders it immediately, flagged stale; the ordinary polling
// loop keeps running and swaps in live data the moment the network returns.
//
// **The on-device store, not sessionStorage** (ADR 0087, M46 spec 08). Until 1.18.0 this module
// wrote to sessionStorage, which survives a discarded tab and dies with the process, and a phone
// kills the process all the time. The pane-list snapshot and the pane text now live in the one
// IndexedDB store (lib/store.ts), under its lifetime, its size caps and its one wipe. This module
// stays as the narrow, typed door to those two record kinds, so the loaders keep one place to ask.
//
// ADR 0017 rider: a pane sitting at a password prompt is never written here, and any text already
// written for it is dropped. The call site (and the reasoning) is in lib/loaders.ts; the drop runs
// through the wipe (lib/wipe.ts `wipeDevice("password", …)`), which reaches the store's cleaner.
//
// Every entry carries the wall-clock of the fetch that produced it, because a stale render must be
// able to say WHEN — "Disconnected — last seen 14:32" is honest, an undated old screen is not.
