// The PWA install offer, held for the moment the operator asks for it.
//
// Chromium fires ONE `beforeinstallprompt` per page when the app is installable and not yet
// installed. Left alone, it becomes the browser's own mini-infobar at a moment nobody chose;
// captured, it becomes a button on the Settings page. This module is that capture: it prevents the
// default, keeps the event, and exposes "is an offer on the table" as a subscribable fact. The
// listener hangs off the module's import (main.tsx pulls it in), because the event fires early and
// a component-mounted listener would usually be too late to hear it.
//
// WHAT ABSENCE MEANS, because the button's absence is this module's main output: the browser never
// made the offer. Already installed (Chromium does not fire it for a running installed app, and
// `appinstalled` below clears a held one), not a secure context (the SW comment in CLAUDE.md — over
// plain HTTP the whole PWA machinery no-ops silently), or a browser that has no such event at all —
// iOS Safari installs through the share sheet and never fires it. All three resolve the same way:
// no card, no dead button, nothing to explain.
//
// The event is SINGLE-USE by contract (`prompt()` rejects the second time), so `promptInstall`
// takes it off the table before calling it — a dismissal is the operator's answer, not an invitation
// to re-ask, and the browser re-fires the event on a later visit anyway.
