// THE race guard for every dialog block — one choreography, no harness in sight.
//
// Tapping any dialog button types into a REAL terminal, and the pane may have moved on between the
// render the user saw and the tap. So before a key goes out, all five action modules do the same
// three things, and they do them HERE:
//
//   1. A FRESH pane read for the same window.
//   2. The fresh read's `revision` must equal the one the block was detected against — checked
//      UNCONDITIONALLY (a 304 only proves "unchanged since the last background poll", and polls keep
//      advancing the ETag cache while a frozen mirror stands still). Herdr 0.7.x's revision is
//      empirically a stub (always 0), so this is defense-in-depth, not the load-bearing check.
//   3. The fresh buffer is re-derived and must still be THE SAME DIALOG. This is the load-bearing
//      check, and it re-derives through `adapterFor(agent).buildBlocks` — the SAME pipeline that
//      produced the block the user tapped — then compares with the kind's contract comparator
//      (harness/dialog-contract.ts).
//
// (3) is why this module exists. Each action file used to import a Claude `detect*` function
// directly, so a non-Claude pane would have been re-verified through Claude's grammar — the guard
// would have been checking a screen against a foreign parser. Going through the adapter means the
// guard verifies exactly what the renderer rendered, and an adapter that emits a block kind gets the
// guard for free: no `detect*` import may appear in lib/ again.
//
// Import direction: lib/dialog-guard → harness/registry (the single "which agent has an adapter"
// decision site) → the adapters. The neutral model modules never import the registry, so nothing
// here can close a cycle.
