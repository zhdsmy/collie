// ── WHERE THE PAGE LEAVES ITS PUSH TITLES FOR THE SERVICE WORKER (ADR 0074) ────────────────────────
//
// A push wakes the service worker, and the worker is what decides the words on the lock screen. It
// cannot read the language the operator chose — that lives in `localStorage`, which a worker has no
// access to — and it cannot load the translated dictionaries, which are lazy chunks a worker cannot
// `import()`. The PAGE can do both. So the page renders the one table the worker needs, the title
// template for every push title code in the active language, and leaves it in Cache Storage, which
// both sides can reach. The worker reads it on each push and fills the `{slot}`s.
//
// Cache Storage and not IndexedDB: one small JSON value, keyed by a URL, is exactly what a Cache holds,
// and `lib/sw-routes`' fonts already live there. The entry is never fetched from the network; the key
// is a URL only because a Cache is keyed by one.
//
// Imported by both sides, so this module holds no state and has no side effect at load.
