// The free-text reply path's race guard.
//
// Every OTHER path that types into a live TUI (prompt-, wizard-, preview-action) refuses to send a
// key it hasn't first verified the pane is ready for — "Enter is never sent blind". The reply path
// was the one exception: it typed the text, waited a fixed 350ms, and fired the submit key with
// nothing checking what was on screen.
//
// That is issue #34, reproduced on a real pane: with a Claude permission dialog focused, the typed
// text is swallowed and the submit key ANSWERS THE DIALOG — approving whatever option was
// highlighted (Claude highlights "Yes" by default). The message is destroyed and the bridge still
// reports {ok:true}, because both Herdr RPCs genuinely succeeded: an ack means "herdr took the
// bytes" (HERDR_API.md), never "the TUI acted on them". So the bridge cannot detect this; only a
// client that can read the input box can.
//
// The fix makes the submit key CONDITIONAL on evidence the text reached the input box: type
// unsubmitted → poll fresh reads until the adapter sees our text on the "❯" line → only then
// submit. If it never appears, NO key is sent and the caller keeps the draft. This is the same
// choreography submitPreviewNote already uses for the note field, applied to the main input.

   * `pane.send_text` doesn't append to it) is DESTRUCTIVE, and it used to run in the composer before
   * `sendGuardedReply` was called at all — i.e. before anything had looked at the live pane.
   *
   * That ordering is the whole bug. The composer decides to sweep from `display`, which is a
   * SNAPSHOT: a poll behind while the mirror follows the tail, and frozen outright while the user has
   * scrolled back or opened find. So its own fail-fast (`dialogPresent`) can read false against a pane
   * that has since put a dialog up, and the sweep then fires into that dialog — the exact
   * keystrokes-into-a-modal failure #34 is about, just upstream of where #34 was fixed.
   *
   * For an adapter that lifts NO interactive kind that fail-fast is not merely stale, it is inert:
   * `dialogPresent` is `buildBlocks(...).some(b => b.kind !== "raw")`, so an adapter whose
   * `buildBlocks` returns one `raw` block by construction can never make it true. Verified live
   * against an omp pane with a full-screen picker up: `dialogPresent === false`. There is no window
   * to widen or narrow there — `composerReady` is the ONLY gate on such a pane, which is why this
   * hook keys on it rather than on the caller having already checked something.
   *
   * The name is the contract: this runs ONLY on the branch where `composerReady` answered true about
   * a pane read moments ago. `force`, a read that threw, an adapter with no `composerReady`, no
   * adapter at all — none of them reaches it, and neither will whatever path is added next, because
   * `preflight` hands the runner back only on that one branch (see `Preflight`). Every other path
   * types without sweeping and leans on type-then-verify, which still withholds the submit key.
   *
   * Resolving `{ ok: false }` aborts the send with that error and nothing typed. `keysSent` says
   * whether anything actually reached the pane: when it did, the pre-flight's evidence is stale and
   * the guard re-confirms before typing.
   *
   * The argument carries the evidence FORWARD, not just the permission. `promptRegion` is the prompt
   * tail the adapter saw on the pane the pre-flight just read, and a caller that sends destructive
   * keys must pass it to `api.sendKeys` as `expected_prompt`: an ordering guarantee alone cannot
   * bound the gap between the read and the keys, because that gap is a network round-trip and the
   * only limit on it is GET_TIMEOUT_MS. Binding hands the last word to the bridge, which re-reads
   * immediately before `send_keys` and 409s the write if the row has gone — the same mitigation
   * every dialog tap already gets through lib/dialog-guard.ts.
