/**
 * Which navigations the service worker must NEVER answer from the precache.
 *
 * The SW's NavigationRoute serves the precached app shell for every navigation it handles, without
 * touching the network. That is what makes deep links work offline — and it is also why an installed
 * PWA, which has no address bar to fall back on, cannot reach anything a fronting reverse proxy
 * serves at a path Collie doesn't own. A proxy that authenticates devices ahead of the bridge
 * (docs/deployment.md, Variant C/E) has a sign-in or enrolment page, and before this list existed there was no
 * legitimate place to put it: the `/api/` denylist was the only crack in the precache, so operators
 * squatted a page inside the namespace the API owns.
 *
 * `/auth/` is therefore RESERVED. Collie routes nothing there, precaches nothing there, and will
 * never claim it for a UI route — it exists so the operator's front door has an address. The bridge
 * answers it with a placeholder explaining that nothing is configured, so an operator without a
 * proxy finds out immediately instead of silently getting the app shell.
 *
 * Kept in its own module, free of workbox imports, so the contract is unit-testable and so the app
 * and the service worker can't drift on what the reserved path is.

/**
 * Navigation paths the SW passes straight to the network. `/api/` was always here (the API must
 * never be answered from a cache); `/auth` joins it, with or without the trailing slash, so a proxy
 * can serve its page at either; `/pack/v1/` joins it because a browser must never be able to cache
 * a collie-to-collie response (PACK_PROTOCOL.md §5).
 *
 * This list is the SW's *only* caching decision that isn't the precache: sw.ts registers no runtime
 * caching route, so denying a path here is denying it from the SW entirely.
 *
 * These are matched against `pathname + search`, NOT pathname alone — verified in the vendored
 * workbox-routing/NavigationRoute.js (`_match` builds `url.pathname + url.search` and tests the
 * denylist against that). Hence `[/?]` rather than a bare `/`: a proxy that bounces you to
 * `/auth?rd=%2Fpane%2Fw1` — the shape Authelia and oauth2-proxy both use — produces the string
 * "/auth?rd=%2Fpane%2Fw1", and a rule anchored on a trailing slash would miss it and hand the
 * operator the precached app shell. That is this whole bug, in its most likely real-world form.

 *  - The DEFAULT UI typeface is on the critical path — it dresses every label — so it is fetched on
 *    the first load and served from this cache on every load after, online or not. It is out of the
 *    precache anyway because that install has to fetch it during the same first paint regardless,
 *    and putting it in `globPatterns` would only make the install pay for it twice. 27 KB. The other
 *    shipped face (Aldrich, 8 KB) is only ever fetched by a device whose reader chose it, and is
 *    cached the same way from that moment on — including offline, which is the point of listing it.
 *
 * Runtime caching is cache-first (src/sw.ts), so an update that renames the file re-fetches once

 * offline on a device that has never loaded the app is not a font problem.
