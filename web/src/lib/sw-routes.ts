/**
 * Which navigations the service worker must NEVER answer from the precache.
 *
 * The SW's NavigationRoute serves the precached app shell for every navigation it handles, without
 * touching the network. That is what makes deep links work offline — and it is also why an installed
 * PWA, which has no address bar to fall back on, cannot reach anything a fronting reverse proxy
 * serves at a path Collie doesn't own. A proxy that authenticates devices ahead of the bridge
 * (README Variant C/E) has a sign-in or enrolment page, and before this list existed there was no
 * legitimate place to put it: the `/api/` denylist was the only crack in the precache, so operators
 * squatted a page inside the namespace the API owns.
 *
 * `/auth/` is therefore RESERVED. Collie routes nothing there, precaches nothing there, and will
 * never claim it for a UI route — it exists so the operator's front door has an address. The bridge
 * answers it with a placeholder explaining that nothing is configured, so an operator without a
 * proxy finds out immediately instead of silently getting the app shell.
 *
 * Kept in its own module, free of workbox imports, so the contract is unit-testable and so the app
 * and the service worker can't drift on what the reserved path is.

/**
 * Navigation paths the SW passes straight to the network. `/api/` was always here (the API must
 * never be answered from a cache); `/auth` joins it, with or without the trailing slash, so a proxy
 * can serve its page at either.
 *
 * These are matched against `pathname + search`, NOT pathname alone — verified in the vendored
 * workbox-routing/NavigationRoute.js (`_match` builds `url.pathname + url.search` and tests the
 * denylist against that). Hence `[/?]` rather than a bare `/`: a proxy that bounces you to
 * `/auth?rd=%2Fpane%2Fw1` — the shape Authelia and oauth2-proxy both use — produces the string
 * "/auth?rd=%2Fpane%2Fw1", and a rule anchored on a trailing slash would miss it and hand the
 * operator the precached app shell. That is this whole bug, in its most likely real-world form.
