 * deliberate: an old cached service worker holds its own copy of this function, sends the tap to
 * `/settings` and lands the operator on a real page one row away from the one they wanted. Renaming
 * the field would have sent it to `/` instead. Same graceful degradation `host` documents below.
 *
 * **This is the app's own URL builder, not a second one.** The query comes from `lib/scope`'s
 * {@link scopeSearch}, so the string the service worker constructs is by construction the string the
 * router already produced for that scope — which is what keeps sw.ts's `client.url !== url` check
 * from firing a redundant navigate on every tap of an already-open pane. It also lives here, rather
 * than in sw.ts, so it is testable at all: sw.ts cannot be imported under Vitest.
 *
 * A SW predating the host field ignores `data.host` and opens the bare pane path, landing on the
 * lead — a reachable screen, and the same graceful degradation `target` already documents. That is
 * why the LEAD is the no-param default and not "the host you last looked at": degrading onto the
 * wrong machine's pane id is exactly the failure the host dimension exists to prevent.
