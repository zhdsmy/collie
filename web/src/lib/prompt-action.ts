// The prompt-select action recipes — the generic race guard (lib/dialog-guard.ts) plus, for the one
// dialog that carries an inline text input, the extra verified steps its MULTI-step choreography
// needs (grammar/PLAN_FEEDBACK_NOTES.md):
//
//   - Answering an option is the digit alone (or digit+Enter for the `select` family): one guarded
//     write, nothing to sequence.
//   - Sending FEEDBACK on a plan is the input row's digit → verify the field focused → type → Enter.
//     The digit does not answer anything; it moves `❯` onto the row and focuses the field, after
//     which the dialog routes every keystroke into the box as text. Enter then submits the box as
//     DENY-WITH-FEEDBACK: the plan is rejected, the agent is handed the text and re-plans. That Enter
//     is irreversible and it is the LAST thing sent, only after a fresh read shows our own words in
//     the box — the same "never submit blind" rule as reply-action and submitPreviewNote.
//
// Both flows start with the same guard as their siblings: a FRESH pane read, the unconditional
// revision check, and a re-derivation THROUGH THE PANE'S ADAPTER compared against what the user
// tapped. The mid-flight polls re-derive the same way, against `promptsSameIdentity` — the feedback
// flow moves the pointer and fills the input by design, so `promptsEqual` would reject its own work.
