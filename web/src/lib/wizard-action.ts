// The wizard tap: one guarded keystroke against the step currently on screen.

// A thin wrapper over the generic race guard (lib/dialog-guard.ts). Under the INCREMENTAL round-trip
// model (grammar/WIZARD_NOTES.md) every tap — an option digit, Left/Right navigation, the review
// step's submit/cancel — is ONE keystroke against the step that is there right now, which is exactly
// what makes the guard's re-derivation load-bearing: a wizard that advanced, re-rendered, or vanished
// between render and tap can never match `wizardsEqual` (harness/wizard-model.ts), so the keystroke
// is discarded and the caller refreshes.
