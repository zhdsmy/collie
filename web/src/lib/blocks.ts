// Semantic Block AST — the intermediate representation between the ANSI parse and the React
// renderer. `raw` mirrors terminal output verbatim; every other kind lifts a dialog into a typed
// payload the renderer draws as buttons. Those payloads are harness-NEUTRAL contracts, each in its
// own harness/*-model.ts (re-exported below): what ANY adapter promises when it emits that kind, so
// the renderers and the race guard are written against the model, never against a harness's
// internals. The discriminated union is shaped so further grammars (tool calls, …) are added as new
// `kind`s without disturbing these.
//
// The pipeline is: parseAnsi(text) → AnsiSegment[] → splitLines(segments) → StyledLine[] →
// buildBlocks(lines, ctx) → Block[]. splitLines (and the pure helpers below) live here; the
// block-BUILDING step is the harness DISPATCHER (harness/index) routing to a per-agent adapter, so
// this core module has NO dependency on the agent grammars — the edge is one-way, which is what lets
// an adapter import this AST without forming a cycle. These functions are PURE (no React) and,
// together with the parser, run once per unique text (memoised by the renderer), so they're off the
// hot polling path. The Claude grammars themselves (prompt-select detection, chrome stripping) live
// in harness/claude; which agents get them is decided by the adapter registry (harness/registry).
//
// Invariant (relied on by find-in-output): joining every RAW block's line text with "\n" reproduces
// the visible mirror text character-for-character. Find operates on global character offsets over
// that string; a prompt-select block is rendered as buttons, so its text is NOT part of that space
// (find covers the raw mirror only).
