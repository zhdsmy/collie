// ── THE UPDATE BAND, AS A PURE READING ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// One top-of-app row carries the whole update subject, and WHICH of its five states is on screen is
// decided here rather than inside the component. Everything below is a pure function of the polled
// snapshot plus two client facts (this tab just posted a confirm; the bundle on screen is stale), so
// the precedence is pinned by unit tests instead of by pulling a DOM apart.
//
// ── THE PRECEDENCE, AND WHY IT IS THIS ORDER ─────────────────────────────────
// A run outranks an offer, a finished run outranks both, peers trail, and an offer is last:
//
//   (s) starting     the confirm was tapped and the status object has not spoken yet
//   (b) updating     the polled run is in flight
//   (c) updated      the run finished and this bundle is behind the bridge
//   (d) peers        the lead finished and a peer is still moving, or one rolled back
//   (a) available    a newer release exists upstream
//
// ── THE BUNDLE AND COLLIE ARE TWO DIFFERENT UPDATES ──────────────────────────
// `lib/self-update.ts` updates the BUNDLE; the update card updates COLLIE. The band renders both,
// and the rule between them is that the band never CHANGES what the self-updater does. `bundleStale`
// is that module's own banner flag, which is true only when it has decided it may not auto-reload
// (a hold is active, or it already spent its one auto-reload for this build). So a band that says
// "Tap to reload" is a band the self-updater was going to ask about anyway; where it would have
// auto-reloaded, `bundleStale` is false and the band says nothing about the bundle at all.
//
// ── THE REASON IS TRUNCATED HERE, NOT IN CSS ─────────────────────────────────
// A rolled-back peer is named with its reason, and the reason is a peer's own prose of unbounded
// length. It is cut on a word boundary to `REASON_BUDGET`, and the Updates page carries it whole.
