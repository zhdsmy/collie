// The client mirror of `bridge/error-codes.ts` — the stable names for the bridge's refusals.
//
// The two trees are type-checked separately (web/tsconfig.json includes only `src`), so the union is
// restated here rather than imported, exactly as `bridge/json.ts` / `web/src/lib/json.ts` already
// do. KEEP THE TWO IDENTICAL: `bridge/error-codes.test.ts` reads both files off disk and fails when
// one set gains a code the other has not.
//
// What lives on each side is deliberately different, and that is the whole point of restating:
//   • The bridge owns the ENGLISH SENTENCE, because it is the fallback that ships on the wire.
//   • The phone owns the TRANSLATION, keyed by these codes through `web/src/lib/i18n/`.
// So this file carries the names and nothing else — no sentences to fall out of step with the
// bridge's, and no second place for English to hide.
//
// READING ONE OFF THE WIRE: `code` is OPTIONAL and always will be. A bridge older than the code it
// is talking to sends `{ ok: false, error: "…" }` with no `code` at all, and a bridge NEWER than
// this file may send a code this union has not met. Both are the same case and both have the same
// answer — fall back to the `error` string the body already carries, which is a true sentence in
// English. Never treat a missing or unknown code as a failure to display.
//
// `detail` rides beside the code and carries the values a sentence needs interpolated — the same
// `{name}` convention `t()` uses, so a translated string can consume them directly
// (e.g. `upload.too_large` + `{ maxBytes: 10485760 }`).
