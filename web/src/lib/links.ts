 * URL, with the rest of the URL as inert text. The logical read has the URL whole, which makes the
 * pairing exact rather than a guess:

 *   · a fragment is considered only when it runs to the END OF ITS LINE — nothing but URL
 *     characters the scan trimmed as punctuation, then the row terminator (`\n`, or Herdr's own

 *     continues it;
 *   · the fragment must be a prefix of exactly ONE URL in the logical text (duplicates of the same
 *     URL — a typed command and its output — count as one), so two DIFFERENT candidates leave the
 *     link alone instead of picking one;
 *   · and the URL is adopted only when its remainder is FOUND in the following lines, compared
 *     character by character from column 0. A complete URL that merely happens to prefix a longer
 *     one elsewhere in the scrollback has no continuation to show, so it keeps its own href.
 *
 * The continuation fragments become ranges of their own with the same href, so the whole URL is one
 * tap target across however many rows it occupies. Fragments keep their own characters — this
 * changes hrefs and adds ranges, never the text.
