// ── THE ON-DEVICE STORE IS ONE THING (ADR 0087, M46 spec 08) ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every piece of session content the phone keeps past a page's life lives here, in one IndexedDB
// database, `collie-store`. Today that is the pane-list snapshot and the last-seen pane text
// (lib/last-seen.ts); the Chat tail of each pane (spec 09) comes next. Drafts, the device token and
// the preferences stay in localStorage, because they need a synchronous read at boot. ADR 0087 holds
// the whole table of what the phone persists, and why each thing sits where it does.
//
// The rules, each enforced here and nowhere else:
//
//   - **Every record carries `fetchedAt`** (epoch ms, the moment the bridge answered with it) and the
//     **instance** it came from: the mount this app was served under (lib/base-path.ts). IndexedDB is
//     per origin, and two bridges can share an origin under two mounts (ADR 0052), so the mount is
//     the bridge identity a cold page knows before any fetch. A read only ever sees its own mount.
//   - **Every record has a lifetime**, 24 hours unless the caller says otherwise. An expired record
//     reads as a miss and is dropped.
//   - **Bounds.** The records of one pane share 256 KiB, the whole database holds 10 MiB, and a write
//     that would cross either evicts the least recently fetched records first. Size is the UTF-8
//     byte length of the record's JSON. A record that cannot fit is refused, and the older copy it
//     would have replaced goes too: a cache answering with older text than it was last handed is
//     worse than a miss.
//   - **A purge on open** drops every expired record, every record from another schema, and whatever
//     the total cap no longer allows. A schema bump that cannot migrate drops the database's
//     contents in the upgrade (`upgrade` below).
//   - **One wipe.** The store registers one cleaner with lib/wipe.ts under the name `store`. A pairing
//     that ends deletes the whole database; a password prompt (ADR 0017) drops that one pane's
//     records. Nothing else clears the store.
//   - **`navigator.storage.persist()` is asked once a page session**, on the first write. The answer
//     is recorded in `storeStatus()` and never shown: a refusal only means the browser may evict the
//     cache under storage pressure, which costs the operator nothing they can act on.
//   - **No record outlives the pairing it was saved under.** Every write caps its lifetime at this
//     pairing's own expiry (lib/pairing.ts `getPairingExpiry`), so a cold open after the expiry reads
//     nothing saved.
//   - **Nothing in the store may trigger an action** (spec 11). It holds text to draw, dated, and the
//     callers own that rule; the store hands out values and never interprets them.
//
// Only text the bridge already redacted reaches the store (spec 07 masks secrets before text leaves
// the machine), and the raw mirror never does: what is stored is what the phone was sent to draw.
//
// FAILURE IS SILENT AND SAFE. Every function is async and never rejects. IndexedDB can be missing (a
// non-DOM test, an old browser), blocked (private mode), hung (Safari's first-load bug), or full. In
// the first three cases the store runs on a memory map for the rest of the page session, with the
// same bounds, and `storeStatus().mode` says `memory`: the app works, nothing survives a restart, and
// nothing says so on screen. A full database refuses the write that does not fit and keeps the rest.
//
// ORDER. Every operation runs on one queue, in the order it was called. A pane's text written and
// then wiped for a password prompt is therefore gone, whatever the two transactions' timing.
