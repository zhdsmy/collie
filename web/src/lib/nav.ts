// Route path helpers. Pane ids contain a colon (e.g. "wE:p2"), so they must be URL-encoded in the
// path; React Router decodes them back in useParams. The active scope — which machine, which named
// session — rides along in the query (`?h=` / `?s=`, see lib/scope.ts) so a navigation stays pointed
// at the pane you were actually looking at. Lead + primary emits nothing, so a solo install's paths
// are byte-identical to what shipped before the host dimension existed.
//
// The host stays in the QUERY, never in the path: a `/host/:h/pane/:paneId` shape would fork every
// route, break every existing deep link, and force the loaders' isPaneUrl() to grow a parser.
