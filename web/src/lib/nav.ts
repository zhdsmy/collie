//   UP       a step back when the entry behind us is a legitimate parent, else a replace onto the

//            next swipe goes down again.
//
// The pure half lives here, beside the paths it reasons about; `hooks/use-nav.ts` wraps it for
// components and `lib/nav-entry.ts` seeds a cold deep link.
