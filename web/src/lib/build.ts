 * prerelease tag's FIRST dot-separated identifier, uppercased, so a beta never gets announced as an
 * alpha; a purely numeric tag (`1.0.0-1`) falls back to `"PRERELEASE"`. Garbage, empty and absent
 * versions return `undefined` — this drives an unmissable banner, so every failure mode must fail
 * toward hidden rather than toward crying wolf on a stable install.
 *
 * The one subtlety: vite.config.ts stamps `-dev` onto BUILD.version whenever HEAD isn't the release
 * tag, so a stable checkout mid-development reports `0.25.0-dev`. That suffix is a build-time
 * "not a tagged release" marker, NOT a SemVer prerelease from the version files, so it's stripped
 * before the test — otherwise every dev build of stable Collie would wear an alpha banner.
