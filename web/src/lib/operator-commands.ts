// The operator's own palette rows (their `commands.toml`), read from /api/config and held in
// module state. Modelled on the lib/server-build.ts store idiom: plain module state + subscribe +
// a useSyncExternalStore hook, so the composer participates without prop-drilling through the route
// tree.
//
// THE CONTRACT: one SUCCESSFUL read is cached for the life of the page; a failed attempt is not
// cached, so a later mount tries again. Never polled, and deliberately not folded into the 1.5s
// snapshot: this is startup config on the bridge side (loadConfig() runs once, bridge/index.ts), so
// re-reading it every tick would spend bytes on a value that cannot change without a bridge
// restart. Which is also why changing it takes a bridge restart AND a page load, not just the
// restart — the same contract every other COLLIE_* var has, and what `.env.example` promises.
//
// A FAILED FETCH IS NOT AN ERROR STATE. With no rows, every pane falls back to its shipped catalog,
// which is exactly what a user without this var already sees. So a refusal (read-only
// device, auth lapse) or an offline start leaves an empty list and no status noise, and the single
// in-flight promise is cleared so a later MOUNT retries. Retry granularity is the reason the kick
// below lives in an effect and not in the render body: the composer re-renders on every 1.5s
// snapshot, so a render-phase kick would turn one refusal into a request per tick, forever.
