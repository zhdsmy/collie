/**
 * Whether the input box's visible draft is evidence that `sent` landed there. The box WINDOWS a long
 * draft (only its tail is on screen) and FOLDS its wrapped lines together with a space, so exact
 * equality is too strict — the strongest claim that survives both is that the draft's visible
 * characters appear contiguously in what we typed.
 *
 * The fold is the subtle part. extractInputDraft joins the box's visual lines with a space, which
 * restores a REAL space only when the box happened to wrap at a word boundary; wrapping mid-run (CJK
 * has no spaces to break at) fabricates a space the sent text never had. The joined string cannot
 * say which kind each of its spaces is, and one string can hold both — "これは pull request です"
 * wrapped mid-CJK has a genuine space AND a fabricated one. So the ambiguity is per-SEAM, not
 * per-string, and no language test can resolve it.
 *
 * Hence: split the draft on whitespace and require its non-space runs to appear in `sent` in order,
 * with only whitespace between them. Every visible character still has to be there, contiguously and
 * in order — only the WIDTH of a gap the fold could have produced is treated as unknowable, which is
 * exactly what the fold destroyed. A draft that dropped or altered a non-space character still fails.
 *
 * Only a gap spelled exactly like the fold's own seam (one plain space) may collapse to nothing, and
 * only that gap is loosened at all. Any other gap — a run of spaces, a tab, an ideographic space —
 * is whitespace the terminal actually rendered, so `sent` must carry that same whitespace verbatim.
 * Without the distinction the guard would accept a screen holding "危険　実行" for a send of
 * "危険実行", or "delete　file" for "delete file": different messages, both authorised.
 *
 * The match must also land on visible-character boundaries, because a code-unit substring can cut a
 * character in half — "👩‍👧‍👦" sits inside "👨‍👩‍👧‍👦" without being it.
 *
 * The length floor stops a short unrelated remnant ("y", "n", a placeholder) from passing as a
 * match; for a send shorter than the floor, the whole thing must be there. It counts non-space
 * characters, since spaces are the part we just agreed not to trust.
