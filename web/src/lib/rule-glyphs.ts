// Shared Unicode rule-glyph classes. Claude's grammar intentionally retains its established broad
// box-drawing contract; visual clipping narrows that to glyphs that are themselves horizontal, so
// a repeated corner/junction can never be mistaken for a terminal-width border.
//
// THIS FILE IS THE WHOLE SHARED SURFACE, AND IT IS MEANT TO STAY THAT WAY. Several tests in this
// codebase decide whether a line is a border; four of them share this file, and the obvious
// tidy-up — one predicate, one threshold — is the change to refuse:
//
//   · `markers.ts` (isBoxBorder / isInputBoxTopBorder) asks whether this is CLAUDE'S INPUT BOX, to
//     decide whether the reply guard may press Enter. Its false positive types a message into a
//     screen that is not the input box. It is therefore the narrowest possible test — U+2500 only,
//     floored in display cells — and not one of these constants.
//   · `blocks.ts` (PURE_HORIZONTAL_BORDER) asks whether this row is TOO WIDE TO WRAP NICELY, to
//     decide whether to clip it. Its false positive crops a short rule. It can afford a broad glyph
//     set and a plain repetition count.
//   · `blocks.ts` (FRAME_ROW) asks whether this row is FRAMED, a boxed menu or a panel, for the same
//     clipping decision. Its false positive clips a line of prose that opens and closes on a
//     vertical stroke. Its alphabet is FRAME_EDGE_GLYPH_CLASS at the foot of this file.
//   · `table-run.ts` (tableRuns) asks whether this row belongs to a TABLE, to decide whether to pan
//     it instead of wrapping it. Its false positive pans readable prose, or worse, a menu. It reads
//     the three classes at the foot of this file plus BOX_DRAWING_RULE_GLYPH_CLASS above, and its
//     predicates and counts are its own.
//
// Same word, different question, and the costs of being wrong are not comparable. markers.ts:86–103
// records what happened the last time one of these tests was reused for the other job — a spaced-out
// prose separator read as an input-box border and defeated the structural guard from the inside.
// Share the alphabet here; never share a predicate or a threshold.
