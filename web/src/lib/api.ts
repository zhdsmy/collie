/**
 * Marks every API request as XHR so a fronting identity proxy answers it with a status we can read.
 *
 * The refusal banner (components/connection-banner.tsx) is reached only through `isAuthError`
 * (lib/loaders.ts), which matches 401/403 on an {@link ApiError}. A proxy that answers an
 * unauthenticated request with a REDIRECT never produces one: `fetch` follows the 302 to the
 * identity provider's origin, that response carries no CORS headers, and the call rejects as a
 * `TypeError` — a transport failure with no status. The user then gets the connection banner
 * ("can't reach Collie") and, worse, loses the Sign-in link that would have fixed it, since a
 * missing session is precisely the thing it recovers from.
 *
 * Measured against Cloudflare Access with no session: a plain request, `Accept: application/json`
 * and `Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors` all still redirect; only this header flips the answer to a same-origin
 * 401. `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` is the conventional "this is XHR, don't redirect me"
 * signal rather than one vendor's feature — oauth2-proxy and Authelia read it too — so it stays a
 * single unconditional header with no proxy-specific branching, in keeping with a bridge that gates
 * on vendor-neutral headers and manages nobody else's front door (ADR 0001).
 *
 * Some forward-auth deployments still turn that 401 back into a 3xx at the reverse-proxy layer.
 * Every API fetch therefore uses `redirect: "manual"`; a returned redirect is normalised to a local
 * 401 below so the same refusal banner appears instead of a CORS/transport failure. Collie never
 * follows or discovers the proxy's login flow itself — the banner's ordinary `/auth/` link remains
 * the operator-owned recovery path.
 *
 * Costs nothing against the bridge itself: it is same-origin by design, so no preflight in practice,
 * and the bridge ignores headers it does not read.
