// The composer textarea's direct-terminal mode: what you type goes to the pane as keystrokes,
// with no trailing Enter. This hook owns the armed state, the transient Android IME composition
// value, the pane-boundary reset, special-key capture, and the lifecycle rules that disarm it.
// Transport ordering stays in useOrderedKeySender so this hook never permits concurrent one-shot
// Herdr writes.
//
// It does NOT own the entry point. Arming is an explicit NAMED choice — the "Type" toggle in the
// composer's Controls row, beside Keys.
//
// WHY A NAMED CHOICE AND NOT A GESTURE. The submitted version of this feature armed the mode on a
// bare long press of the Send button. That reads as a saving of one tap, but the tap is priced per
// SESSION, not per keystroke: you arm once and then type many keys. What it actually buys is an
// accidental hold — a pocket, a fumbled scroll, a hesitation over Send with a destructive command in
// the box — silently pointing the phone keyboard at a live terminal with nothing on screen having
// asked. This surface's safety story is "you see what is about to go on the wire" (ADR 0005), and a
// mode you can enter without reading anything sits outside it. A labelled toggle you press on purpose
// is the cheapest thing that stays inside it. Don't reintroduce a hold as a shortcut.
//
// WHY THE MODE DIES WITH THE VIEW. What stands in for a review step here is that you are LOOKING at
// the pane while you type into it — this is the one write path with no reviewable payload, by design
// (reviewing each keystroke would defeat it). That condition can quietly stop being true: the mirror
// is polled, and the poll stops on an idle pause (ADR 0007), on a backgrounded tab, on a pane going
// away. Hence the disarms below. Never persisted, never restored: there is no path by which this is
// already armed when you arrive at a screen.
//
// Two apparent omissions that are deliberate. A lost connection is NOT a separate trigger — it
// surfaces as a failed batch, which already disarms, observed directly rather than inferred from a
// timer. And the reply guard's `composerReady` pre-flight is NOT run on these keystrokes: it refuses
// to type into an unrecognised screen, and typing into an unrecognised screen is the whole point.
// Don't "harden" this path by adding it.
