// The sending model is a ONE-IN-FLIGHT PUMP, not a fixed-cadence emitter, and that is a correctness
// requirement rather than latency hygiene: Herdr's RPC is one-shot (a fresh connection per call, the
// server closes after one reply), so ordering across two concurrent `send_keys` calls is NOT
// guaranteed — only ordering WITHIN one array is. So we never allow two calls in flight; repeats
// accumulate locally and flush as one batched array whenever the previous call resolves. A laggy
// tailnet therefore produces BIGGER batches, not more calls, which is exactly what the array-taking
// API is for.
//
// Deliberately NOT in lib/key-queue.ts (pure composition — no I/O, no time, no React) and not in the
// Composer (whose pressKeys stays a dumb transport). Pointer state, timers and the pump live here.
