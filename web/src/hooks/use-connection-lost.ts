/**
 * Shared implementation for both connection thresholds: true once `connecting` (isConnecting —
 * offline / snapshot error / Herdr down / stalled) has stayed true continuously for `thresholdMs`,
 * measured from the last PROVABLY LIVE moment. Resets to false the instant `connecting` goes false.
 *
 * Derives entirely from the module-scoped lib/connection-health store — NOT a per-instance timer. The
 * result is a pure function of `connecting` and the shared escalation anchor (`useConnectionHealth`,
 * i.e. `effectiveAnchor()`), so every consumer at a given threshold computes the SAME answer and they
 * cannot disagree across remounts, route changes, or timer drift. The store subscription re-renders us
 * when the anchor moves (a successful poll or a wake); the timeout below forces the re-evaluation at
 * the exact threshold moment, and focus/online are cheap re-check nudges after the phone wakes (when
 * timers were frozen). Wall-clock throughout: a phone that sleeps mid-outage escalates on true elapsed
 * time, not accumulated awake-time.
 *
 * SUSPENDED WHILE THE OPERATOR IS UPLOADING. A voice clip is megabytes going up a phone's narrow
 * uplink; the snapshot poll queues behind it, looks stalled, and used to fade in the amber
 * "Reconnecting…" bar over a link that was working and was busy carrying the recording. So while
 * `useLongUpload()` is true neither threshold is reached and neither latches — the connection has not
 * proven itself dead, it has not been ASKED. Releasing the upload stamps a wake (see
 * lib/connection-health), so the window that follows is a fresh one rather than the stale anchor.
 *
 * `latch` is what separates the two thresholds. Only the 15s LOST escalation latches: the moment we
 * observe it we call latchLost(), and while latched the store drops the wake grace from the anchor, so
 * switching apps and returning MID-OUTAGE can't downgrade a red "not connected" to amber for another
 * window — red stays red until a live poll clears the latch (markLive). The 4s TROUBLE threshold NEVER
 * latches: it's the ambient amber, and latching it would freeze the sticky state at 4s and break the
 * red/green semantics. Both read the SAME latched-or-not anchor, so once latched (red) trouble is
 * trivially true too — bar and dog agree by construction.
