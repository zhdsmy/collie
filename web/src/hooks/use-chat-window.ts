// One pane's live session, held on the phone and moved by the poll that already exists.
//
// ── THERE IS NO TIMER HERE, AND THAT IS THE RULE ─────────────────────────────
// ADR 0073 point 1: the transport is the poll, answered 304 when nothing moved. On this side of the
// wire that means riding `useRevalidator()`'s own loading→idle edge rather than starting a second
// interval. `hooks/use-polling.ts` owns the cadence — five rules resolved from what the operator is
// doing — and it already refuses to fetch behind a hidden tab. A timer here would have to rebuild
// both, would disagree with the first one to be tuned, and would keep reading a session on a phone
// in a pocket.
//
// ── THE MERGE IS NOT HERE EITHER ─────────────────────────────────────────────
// `lib/chat-window.ts` is pure and holds all three merge rules. This hook is the part that cannot
// be pure: a fetch, a cursor and the answer handed to that function. Keeping the split means the
// rules that are easy to get wrong are the ones with no DOM and no clock in them.
//
// ── WHAT A FAILURE COSTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A thrown fetch leaves the held window exactly as it was and says nothing. The connection strip
// above the header is already the app's one answer to "the bridge is not answering" (DESIGN.md
// §11), and a second sentence inside the stream would be the same fact twice. A 404 and an
// `available: false` are NOT failures: they are readings, they come back as {@link ChatWindow.status},
// and the view says them in words.
//
// ── THE SAVED COPY (M46 spec 09, lib/chat-tail.ts) ──────────────────────────
// Every live answer writes the newest turns through to the on-device store, under the lifetime
// "Keep chat on this phone" asks for. A read that fails for want of a bridge (a transport failure, a
// timeout, a 5xx from a proxy whose bridge is down; never a 4xx refusal, never a 404 or a "no log",
// which are answers) then reads the copy back, but only into a window that holds nothing: a cold
// open, or a pane opened while the bridge is out of reach. The copy is marked with `savedAt` and the
// view says so. The next live answer replaces or clears it.
//
// ── A FAILED POLL NEVER DROPS WHAT IS HELD (M46 pass 3, 2026-10-07) ──────────
// A window that already holds turns keeps every one of them on a failed read, whatever the failure,
// and the store is not read at all: memory is newer than the copy. The window is MARKED (`savedAt` set
// to the time of the last live answer, so the view draws the saved-copy line) on the same rule the
// connection strip uses: at once for a read that got no answer (a network failure or the poll
// deadline), on the second 5xx in a row, or when the herd read has already latched the outage. The
// mark stays until a live answer, so the line appears once and does not flap. Right after a wake the
// first read with no answer is one strike and marks nothing (lib/connection-health.ts
// `wakeStrikeHolds`); the herd read's retry decides, and its latch marks the window.
//
// ── THE COLD OPEN, AS THE LOADERS DO IT (lib/loaders.ts COLD_OPEN_WAIT_MS) ──
// What blanked the Chat body on Altan's phone (airplane mode, Tailscale up, 2026-10-07): a view that
// MOUNTS with nothing in memory (the PWA reopened, a page Android discarded) started from the empty
// window and read the saved copy back only once its own fetch had failed. Over a VPN with the radio
// off that fetch does not fail, it hangs until its deadline, and the body stood empty under a strip
// that already said "showing what was saved" (the loaders had raced and drawn their copy after
// 1.5s). Now an empty window reads the copy back at once when the outage is already known, or when
// the pane view says its mirror is the saved copy (`savedCopy`): the loaders' own cold-open wait has
// then already run, and the Chat body follows them rather than starting a second wait of its own.
//
// The raw mirror is never cached here: the Terminal body has no offline read beyond the last-seen
// pane text the loaders already keep (lib/last-seen.ts).
