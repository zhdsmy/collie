 * open (about 23 KB on the wire, gzipped), then once a minute while the page is visible only the
 * minutes from its newest point on (`?since=`, a few hundred bytes), merged in by `mergeHistory`.
 * The minute beat is `useVisibleInterval`: stopped outright while the page is hidden or behind the
 * idle lock, and it reads at once when the page comes back. A round starts only when the last one
 * has ended. `enabled` is false for an id the census does not know, which would only collect 404s,
 * for an older machine, whose day is empty by definition, and while the page shows its Alerts view,
 * which draws no chart. Enabled again, it reads from the newest point it still holds.
