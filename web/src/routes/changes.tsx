// The Changes view (ADR 0065): what changed under a WORKSPACE's folder since the last commit,
// read-only. Two routes share it: `/pane/:paneId/changes` (the bridge resolves the pane's workspace)
// and `/space/:spaceId/changes` (the workspace asked directly). Every pane of a workspace shows the
// same list, and the header names the workspace and its folder so the scope is never a guess.
//
// ONE SCREEN, TWO BODIES (ADR 0083, 2026-10-06). By default the body is the root folder as a tree,
// one folder at a time, with every change marked on its row: a changed file wears its status letter
// and an icon in that colour, a folder says how many changed files sit below it, and a deleted file,
// which the disk no longer lists, is added back from the change set, struck through. The change set
// is this screen's own Changes list, joined by path (lib/files-marks.ts). The screen is called Files.
// The two-segment control under the header, All files | Changes (a per-device pref), swaps the tree
// for the list of changes alone, flat or as a tree, with its filter, its depth note and the way to
// the last commit, exactly as it was before the merge.
// A folder is `…/changes/files?dir=`, a file `…/changes/files?path=`; a changed file opens on its
// Diff, beside Source and, for Markdown, JSON and HTML, a Preview.
//
// The list's own file screen is `?repo=&path=`, one file's diff. Every screen lives in this one
// component so the list survives the hop to a file and back, and Previous / Next can walk it.
//
// THE COMMIT VIEW. Agents commit their own work, so the list goes empty right after the change the
// operator most wants to read. A clean repo offers "Show last commit": `…/changes/commit?repo=` is
// that repo's HEAD, and `&path=` one file of it, with the same list, filter and diff. It is a level
// below the list (a down move; up returns to the list), matched by the same route (`changes/*` in
// router.tsx), so this component stays mounted and the list under it keeps its state. The 5 s beat
// re-reads the commit too, but a newer HEAD never replaces the files on screen: it shows a quiet
// "A newer commit exists" to tap, and new uncommitted changes in that repo show a line back to the
// list.
//
// NOT ON THE ROOT POLL LOOP, BUT ON ITS OWN SLOW ONE (ADR 0065 rule 8). The route has no loader
// (router.tsx), so the root poll re-renders this screen and fetches nothing for it: git status over
// a big tree is not a 1.5 s question. Instead, while the screen is mounted and the page visible, it
// re-reads every CHANGES_POLL_MS (use-visible-interval.ts, which holds a beat while a finger
// scrolls): the list, and on the file view the open file's diff too. A re-read that returns the same
// data changes nothing, down to object identity (`shareEqual`), so nothing re-renders, no row moves
// and sugar-high does not re-colour. A changed diff keeps its colour on every unchanged line
// (DiffView). A failed re-read keeps the last good data on screen. Refresh stays as the manual "now".
//
// THE FIRST FRAME. The head of the Changes list carries the workspace's totals (`+12 −4`), seeded
// from the Changes tab's kept answer so it is right before any read; on the way in, the tab row's
// workspace label glides into the label under the header's title, and back down into the row on the
// back arrow (lib/glide.ts). The row's count line has no twin in the header any more, so it fades.
// The list starts on the last list this page read for the screen (lib/changes-list-cache.ts), or,
// on a first visit, on skeleton rows in the real rows' box, which the first answer fades out of. A
// re-read never shows the skeleton again.
