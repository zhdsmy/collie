// The pack census: the whole pack drawn as a FORMATION, and the answer to "how is my pack doing?".
//
// ── THE BODY IS A SHAPE, AND TAPPING A MACHINE OPENS ITS PAPERWORK ───────────
// The lead stands at the apex, the deputy directly beneath it on a thick connector, and every other
// member is fanned in a V on thin ones (components/pack-formation.tsx owns the drawing and the pure
// geometry). A node carries only what survives being glanced at — a health ring, a name, and a
// "needs you" count — and everything a list used to print instead lives one tap away in a bottom
// sheet: the lead's own word for that member and its reason verbatim, a conflict, version skew, the
// address, the enrolment, and on the lead itself the secret generation and who deputises for it.
//
// ── IT IS STILL A REPORT, NOT A CONSOLE ──────────────────────────────────────
// There is no button here that changes anything, and that is the milestone's rule rather than an
// unfinished edge: join / leave / promote / rotate are CLI verbs (M5 non-goal), so the page names
// what is wrong and stops. The one thing it does is what the ServerSwitcher does — take you to a
// machine — and it is a deliberate second tap inside the sheet, never the node itself. Tapping a
// node on a picture must be free to mean "tell me about this one".
//
// ── WHY IT HAS ITS OWN LOADER RATHER THAN RIDING THE SNAPSHOT ────────────────
// `/api/pack` is a page's worth of detail, and the snapshot is the hot path every phone polls for
// every screen. Its own loader keeps that cost on this page — and, because the loader is a route
// loader, `revalidate()` refreshes it on the ordinary poll while the page is open, which is exactly
// what a status page wants: a member going quiet appears here without a reload.
//
// ── EVERY TIME ON THIS PAGE IS AGED AGAINST THE LEAD'S CLOCK ─────────────────
// `status.ts`, never `Date.now()`. Every timestamp in the payload was stamped by the LEAD, so a
// phone a few minutes fast would otherwise report the entire pack as stale, and one a few minutes
// slow would report a dead machine as current. lib/host-health.ts's header has the full argument;
// this page obeys it for `rotatedAt` and `enrolledAt` as well as for `lastSeenAt`.

          <AlphaBar/>, so walking into the Pack page off a prerelease build silently dropped the "you are
