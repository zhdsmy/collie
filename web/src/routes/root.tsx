/**
 * The "last seen" stamp the ONE connection surface should show — the stamp of the data actually on
 * screen, which is not always the snapshot's.
 *
 * A cold boot straight into a pane re-renders that pane's mirror from the write-through cache, and
 * the two stamps can be hours apart: the operator last opened the pane at 12:05 and left the
 * dashboard polling until 14:32. Dating that 12:05 terminal text "last seen 14:32" is the same
 * dishonesty this whole change removes, one level down — so while a stale mirror is the thing being
 * read, the mirror's own stamp wins, undated included (an undatable mirror says nothing rather than
 * borrowing a number that isn't about it).
 *
 * A stale pane with NO text is not a case: nothing old is on screen, so the herd's stamp is the
 * honest one. Live pane data likewise falls through — the pane is current, and the banner is then
 * describing whatever the snapshot is doing.
