// app-wide". It was not one: the hand-rolled bar carried no <AlphaBar/> and had its own padding
// recipe, so it stood 20px short of every other route's header and silently dropped the "you are on
// a prerelease build" strip on the way in. It fills the one hoisted header shell now, and these cases pin
// that — a false comment in the code is worse than no comment, so the claim is asserted rather than
// written down.

// The index carries NO loader now — the paired-device registry belongs to the one page that
// renders it (/settings/system). The section routes are stubs here: this file tests the index, and
// what each section mounts is that section's own business.
