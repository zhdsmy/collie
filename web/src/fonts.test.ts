// rests on facts that are silent when broken: the stylesheet, the service worker and the disk agree
// on which files exist; the symbol faces stay range-restricted so they stay lazy; the UI face is
// preloaded and metric-matched so its swap moves nothing; and none of them re-enters the precache.
// A renamed file is a tofu box again (#70); a woff2 back in `globPatterns` charges every install
// ~1.2 MB; a URL the SW doesn't know gets swept out of the font cache on activate; a UI face without
// its `size-adjust` twin reflows the whole app when it lands.
//
// SINCE ADR 0033 the UI face is a per-device SETTING, so "the UI typeface" is a list rather than a
// singular. That changes two things here and nothing else: the twin table is asserted for EVERY
// shipped face rather than for the one, and the critical-path facts (preload, boot splash, the size
// budget) target DEFAULT_UI_FONT_URL — the face a device gets when it has never opened the setting,
// which is still the only one on the first-paint path.
