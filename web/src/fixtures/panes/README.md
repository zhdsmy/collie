# Pane-buffer fixtures

Byte-faithful captures of real pane buffers as returned by the bridge
(`GET /api/pane/:id?lines=N`, i.e. Herdr `pane.read` with `format:"ansi"`). They contain **real
ESC bytes** (SGR styling only — Herdr's contract) and are the ground truth for the block-renderer
grammars (tracker M1): line splitting, chrome detection, prompt-select extraction, and the
Claude Code transcript grammar are all developed and tested against these files.

Capture a new one on the deployment host with:

```sh
scripts/capture-fixture.sh <paneId> <name> [lines]   # paneIds: /api/snapshot
```

**⚠ This repo is public.** Pane buffers are real terminal output. Review every capture
(`less -R <file>`) for private content before `git add` — prefer generating states in a sandbox
pane over capturing real work sessions.

## Claude statusline hint over a multi-line draft (captured 2026-09-19)

`claude--draft-multiline-vim-hint.txt` is a byte-faithful capture of Claude Code 2.1.278 in an
isolated scratch Herdr pane (no conversation turn, no model request). The input box holds a
multi-line draft and the TUI paints `ctrl+g to edit in Vim` right-aligned on the statusline row
below it. The draft is synthetic — `/tmp/collie-fixture/…` paths and one CJK paragraph — while the
SGR bytes, the box geometry and the hint's padding are unchanged. It pins the send guard's failure
mode: read as an ExitPlanMode footer, that statusline row hid the whole input box, so a phone reply
was typed and then left unsubmitted ("text delivered, not submitted") on every multi-line send.

`claude--notification-paste-delete.txt` is the same kind of capture, from the same scratch pane: an
EMPTY input box with 2.1.278's `Ctrl+Y to paste deleted text` notification right-aligned on a row of
its own below the mode row (47 columns in, on a 77-column pane). The launch command, the working
directory and the model name were replaced before the fixture entered the repository; the notification
row's padding, its SGR and the box geometry are unchanged. It pins the other half of the same bug: the
row reads as a `<key> to <verb>` hint, which is what a dialog footer reads like, so it refused the
input box outright — the status strip went empty and the composer was greyed, because `hasInputBox` is
the send gate.

## Cursor Agent input, statusline and transcript surfaces (captured 2026-09-18)

`cursor--idle-sanitized.txt` preserves real Cursor Agent ANSI rows for a submitted query, a
two-sided diff, the idle input box and its statusline. `cursor--working-status-sanitized.txt`
captures the working input tail with its separate task-count and metrics rows. Hostnames,
addresses, commands and project content were replaced before either fixture entered the
repository; the SGR boundaries and Cursor's background colours are unchanged.

## Codex native QA and plan dialogs (captured 2026-09-13 through 2026-09-15)

`codex--async-qa-*.txt`, `codex--v0154-question-*.txt`, and
`codex--v0154-notes-*.txt` are byte-faithful captures of isolated Codex 0.154.0
panes. Local synthetic events supplied the questions; the real TUI handled
selection, question navigation, notes, and answer delivery. No production
conversation, external model, or daily credentials were used.

`codex--v0154-plan-*.txt` were captured with temporary configuration and a
deterministic local Responses provider. The short variants preserve the entire
plan and native pointer states; `long` contains only the tail of a 24-section
plan. The remaining captures show the native decision outcomes.

These screens now remain native, along with review and folder-trust dialogs.
The captures guard against accidental cardification, missing native text, and
ordinary chat submissions into modal input. Collapsed async questions retain
their native Alt+Up hint and ordinary composer. See
[`PICKER_NOTES.md`](../../lib/harness/codex/PICKER_NOTES.md) for the supported card scope.

## Codex 0.154 model and statusline pickers (captured 2026-09-13)

`codex--v0154-picker-*.txt` capture a disposable Codex pane with isolated configuration
and a nonfunctional local test provider. No model request was made. Model, reasoning,
advanced reasoning and Plan scope stages retain their native labels and warnings;
statusline captures cover checkbox state, one-position ordering, filtered and empty
search results, offscreen browsing and the absent preview when all items are disabled.
See [`PICKER_NOTES.md`](../../lib/harness/codex/PICKER_NOTES.md) for verified key recipes.

The companion `codex--v0154-statusline-*.txt` captures retain the input region
after saving disabled, single-item and muted multi-item statuslines, with both
default and Plan-mode footer variants. They pin continued composer recognition
after a statusline edit.

## Codex 0.154 saved-session picker (captured 2026-09-16)

`codex--v0154-resume-*.txt` capture the `/resume` screen in an isolated Codex 0.154.0 pane
whose `CODEX_HOME` held a copied state database with every row removed and four synthetic
sessions written back. The corpus covers both row densities, a moved pointer, a longer
window, a filtered and an empty search, and one row expanded with `ctrl+e` (kept as a
negative: its detail block is not a row grammar). Titles, dates, directories and branches
are fabricated; no real session, credential or model request is involved. See
[`RESUME_NOTES.md`](../../lib/harness/codex/RESUME_NOTES.md) for the verified key recipes and
the recognition limits.

## Codex 0.154 command completion (captured 2026-09-13)

`codex--v0154-command-status.txt` is the ANSI input/completion region captured from a temporary
Herdr pane running Codex 0.154.0. Typing `/status` replaces the statusline with `/status` and
`/statusline` suggestions; one Enter executes the local status command and restores the composer.
The preceding startup transcript is omitted. No model request was made. The adapter reads only
the exact command as the draft, checks the selected row's paint, and binds submission to the whole
input/completion region.

## Codex 0.154 input particles (captured 2026-09-12)

Codex 0.154's `codex--v0154-particles-{working,draft}.txt` preserve the actual ANSI input
padding, particle paint, prompt and status from 2026-09-12 Herdr captures. The working
capture replaces preceding private output with a generic indicator; the draft capture
comes from a scratch Codex pane with an unsubmitted sample containing punctuation,
Braille, CJK, an image marker and a path. See `harness/codex/PARTICLES_NOTES.md` for the
recognition and send-binding boundaries.

## Hermes CLI display chrome (captured 2026-09-10)

`hermes--v0213-done.txt` is a sanitized excerpt of the operator's Hermes v0.21.3
(2026.9.14, `140d1254`) pane, captured read-only on 2026-09-17. Response borders,
status metrics, SGR styling and the idle composer are retained byte-for-byte; the
private response body is replaced with harmless paragraphs and the seven-character
session title is replaced with `Example`. The new emblem is `☤`; older captures use
`⚕`. Startup tests separately transform the existing sanitized banner's counts
to include `2 MCP servers`, retaining its width; that variant is synthetic.

`hermes--startup-resume.txt` is a sanitized structural fixture assembled on 2026-09-16:
the logo, startup panel, tool/skill inventory, version/count styles and Welcome/Tip come from
a read-only ANSI capture of the installed Hermes v0.21.2 (2026.9.11, `1021a032`). The personal
path and session ID are replaced, the preceding session-exit statistics are omitted, and the
private history is replaced with the synthetic native-renderer history below. It intentionally
combines a 211-column startup with a 120-column history to cover terminal resizing. It is not
an untouched conversation capture, and gathering it sends no input to the user's session.
It exercises semantic startup fields/groups, decoration removal, relocated useful tips and
role-separated history with Markdown. Normalized searchable rows retain the source-row count;
the startup grid is not reproduced as a horizontally scrolling terminal frame.

`hermes--resume-history.txt` is generated on 2026-09-16 by Hermes CLI v0.21.2
(2026.9.11, `1021a032`), using the installed `_display_resumed_history()` and Rich renderer
at 120 columns with synthetic in-memory history. It preserves native ANSI and frame geometry,
role labels, blank lines, CJK, tool summaries, literal Markdown and a long final context-summary
message. No model, session database, user input or service restart is involved. A separate
read-only capture of the operator's resumed Herdr pane verified real repaint boundaries; that
private capture is not checked in. The fixture is renderer-generated evidence, not a live TUI
capture. See the adapter's `NOTES.md` for detection and display-only boundaries.

`hermes--clarify-{single,q0,q1,other}.txt` capture an isolated Herdr pane running the
installed HermesCLI's real clarify renderer and digit/Enter handlers over harmless sample
questions. The prompt_toolkit host supplies a sample status/composer footer; no model call or
real conversation action was made. The sample's Other footer still uses `? ❯`; Hermes itself
uses `✎ ❯`. Tests cover both modes. Single-question digit submission, batch advancement and
custom-answer submission were observed directly. `hermes--diff.txt` combines the real pane's
captured xterm-256 diff colors with replacement sample text. See the adapter's `NOTES.md` for
the exact provenance, key recipes and conservative fallback boundaries.

`hermes--done.txt` is a sanitized structural capture from Hermes CLI v0.21.1 (2026.9.7)
on Herdr 0.9.0. Response borders, status ANSI, the italic prompt suggestion and composer rules
retain their captured form. Body paragraphs, model and session title use generic replacements;
this is not an unmodified conversation capture. It covers display only, with no verified send
or dialog recipe. Provenance and fallback boundaries: [`NOTES.md`](../../lib/harness/hermes/NOTES.md).

`hermes--working.txt` is a **reconstruction**, not a live working capture. It combines the sanitized
idle capture's status/composer geometry with the default working prompt and italic operation hint
from Hermes v0.21.1's official `cli_tui_mixin.py` and the operator's 2026-09-10 screenshot. It covers
display-only footer lifting; derived tests cover minimal chrome, wrapped hints, drafts and torn
footers. No interactive contract is inferred from it.

`hermes--submitted-input.txt` is a sanitized excerpt from a read-only ANSI capture on 2026-09-10.
The two 40-character accent rules and the bold bullet/input styles are retained; the message is
replaced with generic sample text and line endings are normalized. Only this verified pair is
drawn across the phone mirror, with ordinary body rules and raw terminal mode unchanged.

## Codex corpus (captured 2026-08-22, Codex v0.149.0, sandbox panes)

Byte-faithful `format:ansi` captures with one sanitization pass, every substitution
LENGTH-PRESERVING so row padding stays byte-identical: the operator's username and hostname
(`collie-user`, `collies-macbook-pro-1` — painted in the shell prompt line and host config
path, which no sandbox can avoid), the Darwin per-user temp-dir token
(`sanitizedtempdirtoken000000000`), and the Codex session UUIDs from `codex resume` lines
(`00000000-0000-7000-8000-…`). Codex's chrome is boxless: a
`› ` prompt row (wrapping onto two-space-indented continuation rows) with a dot-separated status
row beneath (`<model> · <cwd> · Context N% left · weekly N% left`); every section of a screen is
separated by exactly one blank row. Approval dialogs need `-c approvals_reviewer=user` — with
`auto_review` (the capture host's default) eligible requests route through a reviewer subagent
and the observed commands were approved with no dialog painted.

| Fixture | State / what's in it | Herdr status |
|---|---|---|
| `codex--trust-prompt.txt` | First screen in an untrusted directory: trust paragraph, `› 1. Yes, continue / 2. No, quit`, `Press enter to continue`. Digit 2 live-probed: quit immediately | `blocked` |
| `codex--fresh-idle.txt` | Welcome banner box, tips, empty `› Ask Codex to do anything` composer, status row | `idle` |
| `codex--draft.txt` | One-line draft on the `› ` row | `idle` |
| `codex--draft-wrapped.txt` | Long draft word-wrapped onto a two-space-indented continuation row | `idle` |
| `codex--queue-context-inline.txt` | Queue hint and context percentage share one raw footer row while the composer remains visible | `working` |
| `codex--working.txt` | `• Working (3s • esc to interrupt)` above a still-visible composer (Codex queues mid-turn) | `working` |
| `codex--approval-exec.txt` | Exec approval: header, Environment/Reason, `$ command`, options `1. Yes, proceed (y)` / `2. …don't ask again… (p)` / `3. No… (esc)`, enter/esc footer. Digits 1 and 3 live-probed (1 ran the command, 3 rejected it — file verified absent); `y` probed too | `blocked` |
| `codex--ask-fruit.txt` | `request_user_input` card: `Question 1/1` header, options with descriptions plus the auto-added `None of the above`, notes footer. Digit live-probed: answers AND submits | `blocked` |
| `codex--ask-wizard-q1.txt` | Two-question set, `Question 1/2`; footer adds `←/→ to navigate questions`. Digit probed: answers and advances | `blocked` |
| `codex--ask-wizard-q2.txt` | Same set, `Question 2/2`; footer `enter to submit all`. Digit probed: submits the whole set | `blocked` |
| `codex--ask-notes-focused.txt` | Notes box open (`› Add notes`, footer `tab or esc to clear notes`): a digit would TYPE — the adapter refuses to raw | `blocked` |

## Codex 0.150.1 corpus (captured 2026-08-28, herdr 0.8.2, Linux sandbox panes)

Byte-faithful `format:ansi` captures from throwaway herdr tabs in `/tmp/collie-codex-sandbox`
(a `git init` repo on `main`) and `/tmp/collie-codex-nogit`. **No scrubbing was needed** — no
username, hostname or home path appears in any of the five files. Every session carries the
host's `codex_apps` MCP 401 startup warning in its transcript; that is real screen output, not
noise added here. **The headline: 0.150.1's DEFAULT status row is two fields,
`<model-with-reasoning> · <current-dir>`, with no `Context N% left` token** — so the
`Context`-bearing `STATUS_ROW` regex never matches. `isStatusRow` therefore also accepts the row
by its RENDERER PAINT (unstyled two-space indent, coloured non-dim fields, dim ` · ` separators),
which is what locates the composer on every capture below. Live-probed the same session with an explicit
`-c 'tui.status_line=["model-with-reasoning","current-dir","git-branch","context-remaining","weekly-limit"]'`:
`git-branch` renders `main` and `context-remaining` renders `Context 100% left`, so the Context
field is simply absent from the default list, not suppressed by a degraded login.
`codex--v0150-working` is MISSING: the capture host's ChatGPT auth could not refresh
(`Your access token could not be refreshed because your refresh token was already used`), so no
model turn could be run.

| Fixture | State / what's in it | Herdr status |
|---|---|---|
| `codex--v0150-idle.txt` | Git sandbox, trust and hooks dialogs answered, empty dim `› Ask Codex to do anything` composer over the two-field status row. Pins that the `Context`-bearing regex does NOT match here, and that the styled acceptor does | `idle` |
| `codex--v0150-draft-wrapped.txt` | A 571-character sentence typed into the same composer, word-wrapped onto two two-space-indented continuation rows (the pane is 216 columns, so ~350 chars would not have wrapped three ways) | `idle` |
| `codex--v0150-nogit-idle.txt` | Same idle screen in a directory with no git repo. The status row is the SAME two fields — no branch field to lose, because the default list has none | `idle` |
| `codex--v0150-custom-status.txt` | `-c 'tui.status_line=["model-with-reasoning","current-dir","git-branch"]'` (Context deliberately omitted) with a short draft on the `› ` row. Pins the styled custom-status design: per-field colours and dim ` · ` separators | `idle` |
| `codex--v0150-paste-placeholder.txt` | One `pane.send_text` of exactly 3000 non-newline ASCII characters lands as `[Pasted Content 1024 chars]` — **N is 1024, not 3000**. Codex's TUI keeps only the first 1024 characters of a single burst, so `draftCarriesSend("x".repeat(3000), draft)` is **false** (it is true for a 1024-character send). See `codex/paste.ts` | `idle` |

## Codex 0.151.0 capture (2026-08-29, herdr 0.8.2, Linux sandbox pane)

Byte-faithful `format:ansi` capture from a throwaway herdr tab in `/tmp/collie-codex-sandbox`, with
one length-preserving sanitization pass on the shell prompt the pane opened with (`user@sbox`, `$`).
Status row is 0.150.1's two-field default, so the styled acceptor is what locates the composer here
too. **The headline: a continuation row is NOT always two-space indented.** The gutter is two
spaces, but what follows it is the operator's own text — and a draft carrying a hard line break
whose next line begins with spaces (one shift+enter, trivial to type on a phone) paints a FOUR-space
row. That is an ordinary draft, not a dialog.

| Fixture | State / what's in it | Herdr status |
|---|---|---|
| `codex--v0151-draft-indented-line.txt` | Two-line draft: the `› ` row, then a hard line break whose text starts with two spaces, painted as a four-space-indented continuation above the two-field status row. `composerReady` must be TRUE — `/^ {2}\S/` refused it, `locateComposer` returned null, and the pane refused every send with "the agent's input box isn't on screen" until the draft was cleared | `idle` |
| `codex--v0154-submitted-fill.txt` | Codex 0.154.0, sandbox pane on 2026-09-15: one submitted user message, an assistant turn, a file edit with its unified diff, and the composer box. The message band and the composer are painted `rgb(240,240,240)` and run to the terminal edge; 0.154.0 paints its diff rows as plain text, with no fill at all. See *Codex light fills* below | `idle` |

## Codex mobile chrome (reconstructed 2026-09-03)

**Not a capture.** This one file is RECONSTRUCTED from the two rows reported in
[PR #144](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/pull/144), which were seen on a live Codex pane the
contributor could reach and this repo's capture hosts could not. It carries real ESC bytes in the
shape the report describes, and it is the ground truth for the labelled-rule clip only. It is still
the only file carrying a `─ Worked for … ───` row and Codex's old fill-painted diff rows, so it
stays until a capture shows both.

Two rows matter, and both are 100 columns wide:

- the **submitted user message**, padded to the terminal width and filled with the truecolor
  `48;2;240;240;240`. The mirror is authored in dark space and inverted under the light theme, so
  that fill lands near-black: a heavy full-width bar on a phone. The two diff rows beneath it carry
  their own backgrounds and must keep them.
- the **labelled separator** `─ Worked for 3m 12s ──…`, a short rule, a label, then a rule to the
  row's end. `blocks.ts` classifies that neutral structural row through shared `StyledLine.noWrap`
  and mutes only its decorative rule runs; the renderer clips it only while wrapping. Codex
  decoration remains fill-only.

| Fixture | State / what's in it | Herdr status |
|---|---|---|
| `codex--submitted-fill-labelled-rule.txt` | Finished turn: the near-white submitted-message row, an assistant line, two coloured diff rows, the labelled `Worked for` rule, then the idle composer and the two-field status row | `idle` |

## Codex light fills (why the rule is luminance, not a value)

`codex--v0154-submitted-fill.txt` was captured to answer PR #144's open ask for a real buffer, and
it answered a second question on the way. The fill in it is `rgb(240,240,240)`, the value #144
reported — but a Codex 0.154.0 pane on the same host, same version, same `tui.theme`, same
workspace, paints `rgb(244,244,244)` on exactly these rows. That buffer is a real work session and
is not committed here; the four-level difference is pinned as a byte string in
[`codex.test.ts`](../../lib/harness/codex.test.ts) instead.

What makes one pane light on 240 and another on 244 is not established. That is the point: an exact
match is a list of the fills someone happened to see, and it fails silently. `lib/harness/light-fill.ts`
matches by luminance instead, and Codex's floor sits at 220 — every fill in this whole corpus is
either Codex's 240 band or 188 and below, so 220 stands in a 52-point gap. A capture that ever lands
inside that gap is the signal to argue the number again.

## Pi 0.85 working editor (reconstructed 2026-09-05)

**Synthetic/sanitized structural reconstruction, not a capture.** Derived from Pi 0.85.0
`CustomEditor`'s embedded `Working` top-border shape at 94 columns, its ANSI segmentation is
constructed. It contains no private transcript payload and claims no byte-faithful captured
provenance: it has a 94-column labelled rule, a 94-space editor row, and a 94-column bottom rule,
with no final newline. It pins the neutral structural clipping and decorative-rule refinement paths
under the raw fallback only; it is not evidence for an agent adapter or status grammar.

| Fixture | State / what's in it | Herdr status |
|---|---|---|
| `pi--v085-working-editor.txt` | Working editor geometry: `── ⠴ Working ` followed by 81 rules, a padded blank editor row, and the bottom border | `working` |

## Grok corpus (live panes 2026-08-21–23)

Grok's composer is a rounded box at the tail: `╭─…─╮` / `│ ❯ … │` / `╰─ <status> ─╯`, then a blank and a key-hint row. The status run is opaque (display name, optional effort, optional permission mode). User-message bubbles use **square** corners (`┌ ┐ └ ┘`) and must never be read as the composer. **All identifying content genericized** per the repo's public-repo rule.

`grok--fresh-idle` and `grok--draft-single` are byte-faithful `pane.read format:ansi` captures from a sandbox pane on 2026-08-23 (Darwin temp-dir token length-preserved). The remaining Tier-1 chrome files (`grok--draft-wrapped`, `grok--working`, `grok--done`, `grok--user-bubble`) are **structure fixtures**: plain UTF-8, LF, no ESC. Live Grok splits the bottom-border status into three SGR runs (rule, status, rule); that shape is pinned in [`grok/markers.test.ts`](../../lib/harness/grok/markers.test.ts) against a reconstructed ANSI buffer from a 2026-08-21 probe. Dialog captures below **are** byte-faithful `format:ansi` from a sandbox pane the same day.

| Fixture | State / what's in it | Herdr status |
|---|---|---|
| `grok--fresh-idle.txt` | Empty `│ ❯ │` box, status in the bottom border, idle hint row (`Shift+Tab:mode`). Byte-faithful `format:ansi` 2026-08-23 | `idle` |
| `grok--draft-single.txt` | Stranded one-line draft `testing stuff` on the ❯ row; hint bar adds `Enter:send`. Byte-faithful `format:ansi` 2026-08-23 | `idle` |
| `grok--draft-wrapped.txt` | Draft wrapped onto a continuation row inside the box | `idle` |
| `grok--working.txt` | Mid-turn; empty box; working hint row under the box | `working` |
| `grok--startup.txt` | Fresh-session welcome screen: banner box (logo, menu) above an idle composer whose under-box row is the bare `[stable]` channel chip, not the hint bar. composerReady must be TRUE. Byte-faithful `format:ansi` 2026-08-22 | `idle` |
| `grok--done.txt` | Square user-message bubble ABOVE an idle composer — the bubble must survive the strip | `idle` |
| `grok--user-bubble.txt` | Torn frame: square bubble, no composer. `locateComposer` must return null | — |
| `grok--permission-rm.txt` | Bash `rm` permission card at the tail; `●` on option 1 (always-approve). Composer replaced. Byte-faithful `format:ansi` 2026-08-21 | `blocked` |
| `grok--permission-rm-moved.txt` | Same card, `Tab` once, `●` on option 2 (Yes, proceed) | `blocked` |
| `grok--permission-rm-feedback.txt` | Same card, `●` on option 3 (reject / type feedback). Digit 3 live-probed: rejects immediately; emitted as No, reject | `blocked` |
| `grok--permission-edit.txt` | File-write permission card, FOUR options (`1` always-approve, `2` allow-all-edits-this-session, `3` Yes, `4` No, reject); footer `1/4:select`. Digits 3 and 4 live-probed 2026-08-22 (3 confirms once, does not persist; 4 rejects immediately). Byte-faithful `format:ansi` | `blocked` |
| `grok--plan-approval.txt` | Plan preview above a composer with placeholder `Build anything`; footer `a:approve` / `q:quit plan`. Byte-faithful `format:ansi` 2026-08-21 | `blocked` |
| `grok--ask-color.txt` | `ask_user_question` card: three color options + `z` free-text; footer `Tab:next answer`. Digit `2` live-probed as submit. Composer replaced | `blocked` |
| `grok--ask-color-moved.txt` | Same card after `Tab` | `blocked` |
| `grok--ask-wizard-q1.txt` | Two-question ask, step `[1/2]` Which layout?; `Enter:select` | `blocked` |
| `grok--ask-wizard-q2.txt` | Same questionnaire, `[2/2]` Dark mode?; `Enter:submit` | `blocked` |
| `grok--ask-multi.txt` | Checkbox ask (`[ ]`). Digit submits — stay raw | `blocked` |
| `grok--ask-multi-checked.txt` | Same card, Pepperoni `[x]` after Tab+Space | `blocked` |
| `grok--ask-size.txt` | Two-option radio + `z` row | `blocked` |
| `grok--ask-z-focused.txt` | `z (●) ❯` empty; footer `Esc:back` | `blocked` |
| `grok--ask-z-typed.txt` | `z (●) ❯ med` | `blocked` |
| `grok--ask-esc-park.txt` | Card still up; footer `Tab/Space:question`. Bare digit probed 2026-08-22: silently swallowed; adapter emits `["Tab","N"]` (Tab re-enters, probed 2x) | `blocked` |
| `grok--ask-z-parked.txt` | Esc from a focused `z`: z row repaints idle, footer says `Tab:next answer`, but inner hint reads `Enter:edit` — keyboard still on the free-text field; a digit TYPES (probed 2x). Buttons must lock. Byte-faithful `format:ansi` 2026-08-22 | `blocked` |
| `grok--plan-tab-prompt.txt` | Plan review after `Tab:prompt`; composer empty; footer `Tab:plan` / `Esc:back` | `blocked` |
| `grok--plan-request-changes.txt` | Same geometry after `s` (request changes = type in composer) | `blocked` |


## Corpus (captured 2026-07-04, Claude Code TUI as of that date)

| Fixture | State / what's in it | Herdr status |
|---|---|---|
| `claude--working.txt` | Mid-turn: `●` text blocks, `⎿` results, `✻` spinner with elapsed/tokens, `※` recap line, `❯` user echo, statusline | `working` |
| `claude--fresh-idle.txt` | Fresh session: empty input box between rules, statusline, usage-limit banner, shell MOTD scrollback above | `idle` |
| `claude--done.txt` | Completed turn: `⏺ Write(hello.txt)` call, `⎿` result, `●` summary, idle input box | `done` |
| `claude--trust-prompt.txt` | Folder-trust dialog: `❯ 1. Yes… / 2. No…`, "Enter to confirm · Esc to cancel" | `blocked` |
| `claude--select-menu.txt` | AskUserQuestion: chip line, question, numbered options **with description sub-lines**, "Type something." free-text row, separated "5. Chat about this", "Enter to select · ↑/↓ · Esc" footer | `blocked` |
| `claude--select-multi.txt` | **Multi-question** AskUserQuestion: a stepper header `←  ☒ Focus area  ☐ Scope  ☐ Workflow  ✔ Submit  →` above the current question, "Tab/Arrow keys to navigate" footer. prompt-select deliberately BAILS on this; since T7 the wizard grammar (`grammar/wizard.ts`) claims it | `blocked` |
| `claude--permission-edit.txt` | Edit permission: diff preview, "Do you want to create hello.txt?", `❯ 1. Yes / 2. Yes, allow all edits… (shift+tab) / 3. No`, "Esc to cancel · Tab to amend" | `blocked` |

| `claude--plan-approval.txt` | ExitPlanMode: plan text, "…ready to execute. Would you like to proceed?", 4 options with hint sub-lines, "ctrl+g to edit in nano · <plan path>" footer | `blocked` |
| `claude--plan-approval--numbered-body.txt` | Plan approval whose plan BODY lists numbered steps ("1. Title / 2. … / 5. TODO stub") inside the option-scan window: the menu is the trailing `1,2,3,4` suffix, body rows drop out (regression fixture for the body-list bug) | `blocked` |
| `claude--plan-approval--feedback-focused.txt` | Plan approval with the **feedback input FOCUSED** (`❯` on `4. Tell Claude what to change`, box empty). Claude routes every digit into that field as text while it has focus, so no answer row can be pressed — the model carries `feedback.focused`, the renderer locks every button behind a banner, and `lib/prompt-action.ts` refuses to write (choreography in [`PLAN_FEEDBACK_NOTES.md`](../../lib/grammar/PLAN_FEEDBACK_NOTES.md)) | `blocked` |
| `claude--plan-approval--feedback-typed.txt` | The same dialog after typing into that input and arrowing OFF it: row 4 reads `use a guard clause instead` — the user's own words as the label — with `❯` back on row 3. The digits answer normally here, and only the row's static `shift+tab to approve with this feedback` description keeps it from being up-levelled into a live `keys:["4"]` button carrying that sentence. Collie will not type into a non-empty box (the caret resets to position 0 on re-entry, so it would PREPEND), so the block shows the text read-only | `blocked` |
| `claude--plan-approval--feedback-wrapped.txt` | A 185-character value in that input, **wrapped** onto a continuation line with `❯` arrowed off. The row re-flows rather than windowing, so the value is rebuilt from the label plus the lines above the hint — and those lines push the footer far enough from the options that `MAX_FOOTER_GAP` needs an allowance or the whole dialog stops parsing (it did, before this was measured) | `blocked` |
| `claude--plan-approval--three-row.txt` | The same dialog on an install with `showClearContextOnPlanAccept` **off**: two answers and the input at row **3**, not 4. Pins that nothing keys on a fixed option count or a fixed feedback key | `blocked` |
| `claude--plan-approval--three-row-focused.txt` | Its pair, captured one keystroke later — `3` was sent and nothing else. The ONLY on-screen difference is where `❯` sits, which makes the two together the real-capture proof that `coreSignature` survives the feedback flow's own first write while `signature` does not | `blocked` |
| `claude--select-multiselect-single.txt` | **Single-question multiSelect** AskUserQuestion: checkbox `[ ]` options under a `←  ☐ Toppings  ✔ Submit  →` stepper, "Enter to select · ↑/↓ · Esc" footer. Lifted to a `multi-select` block — the verified interaction is **DIGIT N toggles option N** (pointer-independent); the closed-loop Submit macro walks the pointer to Submit and confirms | `blocked` |
| `claude--select-multiselect-checked.txt` | Same dialog **mid-selection**: some boxes `[✔]` (Mushrooms, Olives), the stepper's question chip flipped to `☒` (answered). Exercises the checked-glyph lift (`[✔]`/`[x]`/`[✓]` → `checked: true`; terminal is source of truth) | `blocked` |
| `claude--select-multiselect-review.txt` | The multiSelect **review/confirm** screen: `←  ☐ Toppings  ✔ Submit  →` stepper, "Ready to submit your answers?" over `❯ 1. Submit answers / 2. Cancel`, with a `⚠ You have not answered all questions` line (`incomplete`). Lifts the `review` phase (submit = key `1`, cancel = key `2`) | `blocked` |

## In-flight send / self-race corpus (captured 2026-07-18, `collie-demo` sandbox pane)

Captures of the ~350ms window where the composer's own reply sits on the `❯` line before the
bridge presses Enter — the frame `extractInputDraft` misreads as a stranded draft. The fix suppresses
it two ways (cross-poll stabilisation + match-last-sent), so these anchor the parse behaviour those
guards lean on (`web/src/hooks/use-terminal-draft.ts`, `web/src/lib/harness/claude/chrome.test.ts`).

| Fixture | State / what's in it |
|---|---|
| `claude--send-inflight.txt` | `/rename` typed, Enter not yet sent: the slash-autocomplete menu above a `❯ /rename` box at the tail — `extractInputDraft` reads `"/rename"` (the transient false positive) |
| `claude--rename-resolved.txt` | A poll later: the command submitted (`✢ Thundering…` spinner), the box line cleared back to bare `❯` — `extractInputDraft` reads `null` |
| `claude--draft-wrapped.txt` | A long stranded draft that soft-wraps onto continuation lines inside the box (`❯ …` + 3 indented lines). Regression fixture: the multi-line box must still strip off the mirror (it used to stay visible), and `extractInputDraft` folds the continuations back into one space-joined line |
| `claude--draft-paste-placeholder.txt` | A send long enough to trip Claude's paste heuristic: the box holds `❯ [Pasted text #3 +3 lines]` — Claude's own token, not our words — which is why the #34 guard could never verify a long message ([`.adr/0010`](../../../../.adr/0010-long-sends-are-verified-via-the-paste-placeholder.md)). Still ordinary composer chrome: an input box with a draft, `composerReady` true, no dialog. **Derived** from `claude--draft-wrapped.txt` (its four draft rows replaced by the token line; every other byte carried over) |

## Background-agents footer corpus (structure from real panes 2026-07-19, SANITIZED)

A newer Claude Code UI paints a "background agents" footer BELOW the statusline/hint — a blank line,
a bold `● main` header, then one `◯ <agent> <task…> · ↓ <tokens>` row per background agent. Those
extra lines broke `locateInputBox` (it tolerated only the statusline window), so the whole box stayed
visible on the mirror **and** no draft chip surfaced. Byte-faithful SGR/CRLF structure taken from real
panes; **all identifying content genericized** (paths, session/agent names, tasks, tokens) per the
repo's public-repo rule. The parser tolerates the footer as chrome by POSITION (a blank-separated
non-blank run below the statusline), never by content.

| Fixture | State / what's in it |
|---|---|
| `claude--draft-footer-empty.txt` | Empty `❯` box with the footer below it — box + statusline + hint + footer all strip; `extractInputDraft` → `null` (no chip) |
| `claude--draft-footer-single.txt` | A single-line stranded draft on the `❯` line, footer below — draft recovered, box + footer stripped |
| `claude--draft-footer-wrapped.txt` | A wrapped multi-line draft, footer below — continuations folded back into one line, whole box + footer stripped |

## Generic-menu corpus (captured 2026-08-05, sandbox pane; decision in [`.adr/0009`](../../../../.adr/0009-a-generic-menu-is-driven-by-the-keys-it-names.md))

Claude Code's `/model` picker — a full-screen modal that is **not** an AskUserQuestion dialog: no
`Enter to select` footer, numbered rows that no grammar may turn into digit buttons (a digit here
confirms **and** saves the user's default for new sessions), and **no input box at the tail**, which
is why a composer send used to be typed straight into it. Claimed by the last-resort footer grammar
(`grammar/menu.ts`), which runs only after all four specific detectors decline.

| Fixture | State / what's in it |
|---|---|
| `claude--menu-model-picker.txt` | Picker open, `❯` on row 1: title `Select model`, five numbered rows with description columns, an `◐ Medium effort ←/→ to adjust` row, and the key-hint footer `Enter to set as default · s to use this session only · Esc to cancel`. Lifts a `menu` block with three actions + Up/Down + Left/Right |
| `claude--menu-model-picker-moved.txt` | The same picker after `2×Down` (`❯` on row 3) — same title and actions, **different signature**. The race-guard fixture: a committing key must refuse a tap on the earlier render, an arrow must not |
| `claude--menu-model-picker-dismissed.txt` | After `Esc`: the ordinary input box + statusline are back. The **negative control** — its statusline is `·`-separated like a key-hint footer, so only the input-box gate keeps it raw |

## Slash-autocomplete corpus (captured 2026-09-01, Claude Code v2.1.257, live pane)

Claude Code's **command-completion popup** — the run of rows it paints directly under the input
box's bottom border while the draft is still a partial slash command. It is the picker's opposite
number: the input box is **live** underneath it, so this is composer chrome plus a list, never a
modal. Read by `harness/claude/autocomplete.ts` and classified as the input box's tail by
`locateInputBox`, because the run is far taller than `MAX_STATUS_LINES` and used to hide the box
behind it — `composerReady` false, every send stalled, the whole 220-column grid soft-wrapped onto
the phone. Since ADR 0048 the box is found by its own frame first, so a popup row the grammar cannot
read no longer hides it. Selection inside the popup is **SGR-only** (the highlighted row is byte-identical to its
neighbours), so the grammar matches on shape and never on colour.

| Fixture | State / what's in it |
|---|---|
| `claude--autocomplete-slash-long.txt` | `/model` typed on a machine with many skills: 23 popup rows — 17 entries at a description column of 43, six of whose blurbs wrap onto a continuation row. **No statusline and no key-hint footer**: while the popup is open the run reaches the last line of the screen. The capture the bug was diagnosed from |
| `claude--autocomplete-slash-short.txt` | The 3-row shape (`/re` → `/rename`, `/resume`, `/release-notes`) at a description column of 23, first row highlighted. **Derived**: written to the same layout and SGR palette as the long capture, at a width that fits the page |
| `claude--autocomplete-slash-clipped.txt` | `/model` typed on an **82-column** pane: 27 popup rows, 19 entries at a description column of 31, descriptions wrapped to two rows and clipped with a trailing `…`. One plugin command's name is clipped from the left to `…ugin:refactor-dependencies`, the row that used to end the run early, hide the box and stall the send. **Hand-built** from a live 82-column observation (2026-09-17): the layout is the observed one, the session label (`demo-session`), transcript and command names are neutral stand-ins, none from the operator's workspace |

## Model-alias capture (2026-09-13, Claude Code v2.1.270, throwaway Herdr pane)

One byte-faithful `pane.read format:ansi` capture, and the only thing it is evidence for is that
Claude Code takes an ALIAS as an argument to `/model`. The harness bar's Claude Model chooser offers
`opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku` and `default`, and those four names are the one set of strings in
[`harness-bar.ts`](../../lib/harness-bar.ts) that no published catalog vouches for — so the row cites
this file. `/model sonnet` was typed into an idle pane in `/tmp/fable-capture-claude` and Enter
pressed; nothing else was sent, and no model turn was ever run. Claude answered on the row under the
echo, and the statusline under it moved from `[Opus·medium]` to `[Sonnet·xhigh]` in the same frame.
That acknowledgement is the whole point of the file: it says the command was understood, not merely
that it was accepted as text.

CRLF throughout with no trailing newline; `wc -l` is 62.

**One sanitization pass, LENGTH-PRESERVING, two substitutions.** The welcome banner names the
subscription the session runs on (`Claude Max` → `Claude Pro`), and the statusline's `LIMITS` row
prints per-account quota, whose four values become zeroes (`12%`, `31m`, `14%`, `18h` → `00%`, `00m`,
`00%`, `00h`) the way the OMP approval corpus below zeroes its own. Byte length is unchanged, 2799
before and after. Nothing else needed it: the cwd is a throwaway `/tmp` directory, and no username,
hostname, home path, email, session id or credential-shaped string appears in the file.

| Fixture | State / what's in it | Herdr status |
|---|---|---|
| `claude--model-alias.txt` | `❯ /model sonnet` echoed on a filled row, then `⎿ Set model to Sonnet 5 and saved as your default for new sessions`, a screen of blank rows, and the idle input box above a `LIMITS` row and a `[Sonnet·xhigh]` statusline | `idle` |

**Running this capture changes the operator's saved default.** Claude's own sentence says so, and the
`model` key in `~/.claude/settings.json` really moved. Put it back by hand after capturing, or capture
with an isolated `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`.

## Capture lab corpus (captured 2026-09-17, Claude Code 2.1.274, throwaway Herdr session)

64 byte-faithful `pane.read format:ansi` captures from ONE real Claude Code session, driven through
a throwaway Herdr session (`--session claude-lab`) in a `/tmp` git project seeded with fake
commands and skills, at seven pane widths from 40 to 200 columns. Taken for tracker M31 to prove the
box-anchored locator ([ADR 0048](../../../../.adr/0048-the-input-box-is-found-by-its-own-frame.md))
against real screens instead of hand-built ones. **Width is a recorded fact here**: it is in the
file name (`--w<cols>`, plus `--h<rows>` where the pane was short), and it is in the table below.
The renderer was the classic TUI, the config directory was isolated, and no user plugins, hooks or
skills were loaded.

`claude-lab-corpus.json` beside
[`harness/claude/claude-lab-corpus.test.ts`](../../lib/harness/claude/claude-lab-corpus.test.ts)
carries the reading a CORRECT locator would produce for every file here, written from the screen
rather than from the code, and the test asserts it. The critical line it holds: on every capture
with a live dialog the locator reports **no** box. Four screens are pinned as known gaps, each with
its reason in the table entry — the background-agents screen, a wrapped draft whose continuation row
opens with `❯`, shell (`!`) mode, and a statusline printing numbered rows. Deleting a gap's fields
when a fix lands is how the table signals the fix.

**Two captures the lab recommended are deliberately NOT here:** its 82-column Edit-permission
screens, at 49 and at 30 rows. Every other Claude capture in this directory names Claude somewhere
on screen — usually in the welcome banner, sometimes in a `No, and tell Claude what to do
differently` option row — and that name is what `harness/agy/markers.ts` `isAlienBuffer` reads to
keep the agy adapter off a foreign buffer. On those two screens the banner has scrolled away and the
third option is a bare `No`, so the word never appears, and agy's prompt-select then lifts Claude's
numbered options. The cross-adapter fail-closed contract in `harness/agy/agy.test.ts` covers every
`.txt` in this directory, so it cannot hold while those two files are on disk. The older corpus
passed that guard by luck, not by design. Promoting them needs an agy-side fix first, not a wider
name list: the screens carry no Claude-specific phrase to match.

**The prefix is `claude-lab--`, not `claude--`, on purpose.** Six suites glob `claude--*.txt` and
check the whole Claude corpus against a hand-curated per-fixture table. Adding 66 captures to all of
them in one mechanical edit would bury the signals those tables exist to raise. These files are
ordinary Claude captures all the same; promote one into `claude--` by hand when a suite there wants
it.

**One sanitization pass, LENGTH-PRESERVING.** Only the `/status` screen carried identity (an email
address, an organisation name and a session id); those became `alice@exampleco.dev` and zeroes. No
username, hostname, home path or real project path appears in any file: the session ran from
`/tmp/claude-lab/project` and every command and skill name in the popups is a lab invention.

| `claude--wizard-submit.txt` | Submit review step, all answered: `● question / → answer` pairs, `❯ 1. Submit answers / 2. Cancel` — **no hint footer** (the tail anchor differs from every other dialog) |
| `claude--wizard-submit-unanswered.txt` | Review reached by Right-skipping unanswered questions: `⚠ You have not answered all questions`, submit still offered |

## Preview-variant corpus (captured 2026-07-05, sandbox pane; choreography in `../../lib/grammar/NOTES_NOTES.md`)

The PREVIEW variant of AskUserQuestion (`!multiSelect` + ≥1 option with a `preview` field): a
fixed-width option column, the pointed option's preview pane on the right, and the per-question
**notes** affordance (`n to add notes` in the footer). Detected by `grammar/preview-select.ts`;
deliberately NOT matched by prompt-select or the wizard grammar.

| Fixture | State / what's in it |
|---|---|
| `claude--select-preview.txt` | Single preview question, pointer on row 1, `Notes: press n to add notes` hint |
| `claude--select-preview-note-input.txt` | Note input **focused**: placeholder `Add notes on this design…`, footer gains `ctrl+g to edit in nano` |
| `claude--select-preview-note-attached.txt` | Committed note (`Notes: prefer subtle shadows`), input blurred |
| `claude--wizard-preview-q1.txt` | 2-question wizard whose Q1 is a preview step: stepper header above the preview layout |
| `claude--wizard-preview-note-attached.txt` | Same wizard step with a note attached |
| `claude--wizard-multiselect-q1.txt` | **A multiSelect question as one STEP of a wizard** — the shape no grammar owned. Stepper `←  ☐ Toppings  ☐ Crust  ✔ Submit  →`, checkbox rows with description sub-lines, and a navigable **`Next`** row (not `Submit`) because this isn't the last question |
| `claude--wizard-multiselect-checked.txt` | Same step with boxes 1 and 3 ticked; the question chip flips `☐`→`☒` on the FIRST tick — "answered" means touched, not complete |
| `claude--wizard-multiselect-pointer-next.txt` | Same step with the `❯` pointer on the `Next` row — the state the advance macro walks to and verifies before pressing Enter. Note the footer gains `ctrl+g to edit in Vim` here, which is why the signature stops before it |
| `claude--wizard-multiselect-final.txt` | A multiSelect as the **LAST** step: the row reads `Submit`, and the earlier chip shows `☒ Size` |
| `claude--wizard-preview-wrapped-label.txt` | Same wizard step whose **option 1 label wraps** onto two continuation rows, so the numbered rows are no longer adjacent — the shape that used to defeat detection entirely. **Derived**, not captured: the left gutter of `claude--wizard-preview-q1.txt` was rewritten and every byte from the Notes column rightward carried over untouched (the observed live shape came from a real pane whose content can't go in a public repo) |

All sandbox-generated (a scratch pane driven through the bridge) except `claude--working.txt`,
which is a real pane working on this repo. Every `blocked` fixture's menu sits at the **buffer
tail** — the invariant T2's detector leans on.

## omp corpus (captured 2026-08-11, oh-my-pi `omp` v17.2.12, three sandbox panes)

The second adapter's corpus (`web/src/lib/harness/omp/`). omp inverts Claude's composer layout — the
statusline is painted INTO the box's top border, the draft's LAST fragment sits ON the bottom border
with earlier fragments stacked above it, and autocomplete renders BELOW the box — so none of Claude's
chrome constants transfer and every one of these captures had to be re-derived.

That adapter is **Tier 1**: it strips chrome and re-surfaces the statusline and a stranded draft, and
it up-levels **nothing**. So every row below is a capture the adapter must leave as a raw block, and
all twenty-one are asserted that way (`harness/omp.test.ts`). Ten carry a live composer; the other
eleven are modals the reply pre-flight has to refuse, and they are **six picker screens** (`/model`,
`/settings` and `/resume`, each with a moved-selection twin) plus **five `ask`-tool screens**.

**omp's tool-approval dialog now has its own section below** ("OMP tool-approval corpus", captured
2026-09-10). It used to be this corpus's known gap, and the reason it mattered is worth keeping:
`ompBuildBlocks` returns a `raw` block *unconditionally*, so an approval screen could never be
up-levelled whether or not anyone had seen it — but the pre-flight's `false` on one was **inferred**
from the eleven modals here rather than measured, on the one screen where a wrong `true` would be
worst. That inference rested on a premise nothing tested: whether omp draws that screen as a box at
all. It does, and the captures below measure it.

| Fixture | State / what's in it | Herdr status |
|---|---|---|
| `omp--fresh-idle.txt` | Fresh session: welcome tips scrollback, `✔ New session started`, an EMPTY composer. omp paints no placeholder in an empty box — there is no `INPUT_PLACEHOLDERS` analogue to write | `idle` |
| `omp--working.txt` | Mid-turn: `⠸ Working… ⟦esc⟧` braille spinner above an empty composer | `working` |
| `omp--done.txt` | Completed turn, and the `◀ N` variant: omp splices a transcript-scroll indicator into the SAME border it paints the statusline into. Pinned as a known limitation of `extractStatusLines` (the trim stops at the `1` segment) | `idle` |
| `omp--done--tool-result.txt` | Completed turn ending in a boxed tool result (`╰───╯`, corner-to-corner) plus a `※ recap:` line. The negative control for the composer-bottom literal: this box closes with no gutter | `idle` |
| `omp--draft-single.txt` | A stranded draft that fits one row, written into the bottom border: `╰─ list the files in this repo ─╯` | `idle` |
| `omp--draft-ghost-suggestion.txt` | The same draft with omp's **inline completion suggestion** painted after it: `repo` unstyled, then `sitory` in a muted foreground, then the padding. The ghost is not in the input buffer, so `extractInputDraft` must read `list the files in this repo` — reading the row verbatim stalled every reply with "Message didn't reach the input box" (`composerGhost`, omp/markers.ts). **Derived** from `omp--draft-single.txt`: the SGR run and six ghost cells were spliced in and six padding cells taken out, so the row still measures 189 cells and every other byte is carried over | `idle` |
| `omp--draft-ghost-suggestion-busy.txt` | The same ghost on the shape **omp 18** draws while the agent is WORKING: the draft itself carries an explicit theme foreground (`38;2;242;244;248`), so the suggestion is no longer "colour after no colour". The first `composerGhost` rule anchored on the draft being unstyled, found no anchor here, and every busy pane went back to stalling. **Derived** from `omp--draft-ghost-suggestion.txt`: one SGR run spliced in before the draft, and the welcome banner's version retargeted `v17.2.12` → `v18.0.11` (same length), so no cell is added or removed | `idle` |
| `omp--draft-wrapped.txt` | A 355-char draft soft-wrapped over three rows — two `│  …  │` continuations ABOVE the bottom border, which carries the tail (`hand`). Regression fixture for the fold direction | `idle` |
| `omp--menu-dismissed.txt` | The welcome panel (a 100-cell `╭───┴───╮` box) plus an MCP failure notice above an empty composer. Negative control: a second, narrower box on screen must not be spliced into the composer's geometry | `idle` |
| `omp--slash-palette.txt` | `/` typed: the autocomplete renders BELOW the box, at the box's own width, with one wrapped entry (3 rows) — a `skill:…` row, which omp assembles from the capturing machine and which is therefore NOT an omp built-in. `extractInputDraft` reads `"/"` | `idle` |
| `omp--slash-palette--filtered.txt` | `/new` typed: five palette rows below the box, all omp built-ins — but note they are everything omp fuzzy-matched for `new`, an accident of one search rather than a curated set. One of three sources for `lib/agent-commands.ts`'s `omp` catalog (collie draws its own palette for an omp pane, because the chrome strip takes omp's); the other two are the tip line and this table — see below | `idle` |
| `omp--select-menu.txt` | The `ask` tool's single-choice dialog (`╭─ Ask ─╮` box, `❯ ○ Red` rows, an `○ Other (type your own)` free-text escape). **Declined** — a different widget whose `handleInput` is unread, and whose escape row would strand a phone user in a free-text input | `blocked` |
| `omp--select-menu-moved.txt` | The same dialog with the pointer moved | `blocked` |
| `omp--select-multi.txt` | The `ask` tool's multi-select (`☐ Cheese` rows under a `toppings / Submit` chip row). **Declined** — same reasons, plus omp never numbers its options, so the shared multi-select model's `String(o.n)` walk has nothing to read | `blocked` |
| `omp--select-multi-checked.txt` | The same dialog mid-selection (`☑ Cheese`) | `blocked` |
| `omp--select-multi-review.txt` | Its review screen — whose body is `1. toppings: Cheese, Olives`, a NUMBERED SUMMARY rather than a numbered menu. The exact digit trap [`.adr/0009`](../../../../.adr/0009-a-generic-menu-is-driven-by-the-keys-it-names.md) exists for | `blocked` |
| `omp--menu-model.txt` | `/model`: a two-pane provider/model picker, footer `Enter assign roles · ↑/↓ providers · → models · type to search · Esc close`. **Declined** — `parseKeyHintFooter` returns `[]` for it (omp writes `<key> <verb>`, not `<key> to <verb>`) | `idle` |
| `omp--menu-model-moved.txt` | The same picker with the selection moved | `idle` |
| `omp--menu-settings.txt` | `/settings`: a tabbed panel. **Declined** — its footer is the ONE omp footer `parseKeyHintFooter` parses, and it yields only `{Jump sections, [Tab]}` + `{Close, [Escape]}`, because `menuKeyFor` rejects the compound tokens (`Enter/Space`, `←/→`, `Type`) its real actions are named with. A modal whose only button is "Jump sections" is worse than the raw mirror | `idle` |
| `omp--menu-settings-moved.txt` | The same panel with the selection moved | `idle` |
| `omp--menu-resume.txt` | `/resume`: the session picker. **Declined** — `parseKeyHintFooter` returns `[]` for its footer too, and the footer is worth reading before writing any omp grammar: `[Del/⌫ delete · Enter select · Tab all projects · Esc cancel]` names `Del`, which is neither on `menuKeyFor`'s whitelist nor a key `pane.send_keys` accepts | `idle` |
| `omp--menu-resume-moved.txt` | The same picker with the selection moved | `idle` |

**No picker's confirm key was ever pressed.** Every dialog here was driven onto the screen, captured,
and dismissed with `Escape`.

**This corpus is also the whole provenance of omp's slash catalog** (`lib/agent-commands.ts`), because
omp ships no command reference to read. A command may only enter that catalog on one of three
warrants, and each row there is marked with which:

1. **A palette row** — a line of omp's own `/` autocomplete in the two captures above.
2. **omp's own tip line** — `` Tip: `/shake` rips heavy tool results out of context to reclaim tokens
   without a full /compact `` , printed above the composer in 8 of these 20 captures. It names
   `/shake` and `/compact` outright and is where both of their descriptions come from.
3. **This table** — a command it records as having been TYPED to produce a fixture (`/model`,
   `/settings`, `/resume`). That the command was run and its screen captured is stronger evidence
   that it exists than a palette row is; it is weaker on what the command *does*, so those rows are
   described by the screen and nothing further.

If you extend the catalog, extend this list first. A command with no warrant here is a guess, and the
catalog types itself into a live shell.

**Sanitized in place, length-preserving — no capture here is raw.** Everything identifying was
rewritten to a fabricated equivalent of the SAME byte length, ASCII for ASCII, so every row's column
alignment and display width survives byte-for-byte. Two classes were replaced, across all 20 files at
once:

- **Environment.** The cwd reads `…abc-0123456789ab/scratchpad/omp-sandbox`; MCP servers read `alfa` /
  `Sample Hub` / `example-cli` / `sandcastle` / `diagram-validator` / `skyline` / `pear` / `spinner`;
  session titles are sandbox prompts and the palette entry reads `skill:sample-doc-tool` over an
  `example.test` URL.
- **Vendor account state.** omp prints the provider a session runs on (the welcome panel's centred
  line) and, in `/model`, marks with `●` which providers the user is signed into above the `○`
  catalogue of the rest. Every name in that `●` column — and every `<provider>/<model>` row it feeds
  in the right pane — was replaced, so both panes stay in sync: `amazon-bedrock`→`example-vendor`,
  `cursor`→`vendor`, `bedrock-mantle`→`example-mantle`, `google`→`sample`, `llama.cpp`→`local-rig`,
  `lm-studio`→`local-lab`, `ollama`→`native`. **Count on yours, not on this list** — the hit counts are
  a property of one capture session, not of omp. `google` and `ollama` match only when NOT
  followed by `-`: the hyphenated `google-vertex` / `google-gemini-cli` / `google-antigravity` /
  `ollama-cloud` rows live in the `○` column, which is omp's shipped catalogue — the same on every
  install, so it is not user data and stays verbatim. `Cursor` also survives inside `/settings`' own
  `Show Hardware Cursor` label, which is a terminal setting, not the vendor.

What the pass deliberately keeps is the SHAPE the detectors read — seven configured providers, their
model counts, the `●`/`○` split, every column boundary. **Redo this before `git add`, not after.** The
whole-corpus check is that `amazon-bedrock|bedrock-mantle|cursor|llama\.cpp|lm-studio` returns only
the two `Show Hardware Cursor` lines, and that `/Users/`, `/home/`, an email, a
`sk-`/`ghp_`/`AKIA`-shaped string and a session UUID each return nothing.

**⚠ Line endings vary per fixture and must NOT be normalised.** Each capture is either **all-CRLF or
all-LF** — never mixed, never a lone `\r`, and none ends in a trailing newline — so a file's CRLF
count always equals its `wc -l`, one FEWER than the rows it draws (27 CRLFs ⇒ 28 rows). The counts
below are that `wc -l`, i.e. what `grep -c` reports. Twelve are all-CRLF: `menu-dismissed` 27, `select-menu` and
`select-menu-moved` 55, `menu-model*` / `menu-resume*` / `menu-settings*` 56, `select-multi*` 58. The
other ten — `fresh-idle`, `working`, `done`, `done--tool-result`, `draft-single`,
`draft-ghost-suggestion`, `draft-ghost-suggestion-busy`, `draft-wrapped`, `slash-palette` and
`slash-palette--filtered` — are all-LF
with **zero**. The alternate screen is a
good guess at which is which but not a rule: `omp--menu-dismissed.txt` paints an ordinary inline
screen and is still all-CRLF, so re-measure rather than infer (`grep -c $'\r' <file>`). Any edit must
be made in **binary mode**; a text-mode Python pass silently strips `\r` and changes every byte count.

Two more things a future omp detector must not assume. omp's pickers run on the **alternate screen**,
so `pane.read source=recent` returns exactly `viewport_rows` lines with no scrollback — "there is
transcript above the dialog" is not available as corroborating evidence the way it is for Claude. And
omp's `agent_status` stays `idle` while a picker is up; only the `ask` tool flips it to `blocked`.
**Nothing may gate on `blocked`.**

## OMP 18.1.10 rule composer corpus (captured 2026-09-05, herdr 0.8.x, version not recorded by the capture, sandbox pane)

Three byte-faithful `pane.read format:ansi` captures from a throwaway Herdr pane in a generic git
sandbox, with OMP 18.1.10 launched under an isolated `composer.shape: rule` config overlay. No
substitution was needed: the visible cwd is the generic `…ie-rule-sandbox`, the draft text is
synthetic, and the files contain no account, host, home-directory, session, credential-shaped string
or UUID. All three are CRLF throughout with no trailing newline; their `wc -l` counts are 28, 28 and
32 respectively.

This shape has no bottom border. Its OMP-local scanner (`harness/omp/rule.ts`) therefore accepts only
the complete renderer choreography at the pane tail: a top rule directly adjacent to `❯`, at most
100 two-space continuation rows, exactly one blank gap, then one standalone status row as the final
non-blank row. The OMP modal corpus and every Claude, Codex and Grok fixture are rejection cohorts;
the adapter conformance suite requires `composerReady` and its prompt binding to decline them.
Nothing is shared with the Claude harness beyond independently recognizing similar glyph geometry.

| Fixture | State / what's in it | Herdr status |
|---|---|---|
| `omp--v18-rule-idle.txt` | Empty `❯` row below the top rule, one blank gap, then the standalone status row | `idle` |
| `omp--v18-rule-draft.txt` | The same tail with `COLLIE_RULE_DRAFT` stranded on its single prompt row | `idle` |
| `omp--v18-rule-wrapped.txt` | A five-row wrapped draft whose final `s` is a styled inline suggestion, not part of the input buffer | `idle` |

Live verification drove this checkout's real Collie UI against the same OMP 18.1.10 sandbox. With
`COLLIE_RULE_18110_STALE` stranded in the rule composer, the guard bound the clear to that exact
prompt, typed `COLLIE_RULE_18110_LIVE_ACK` with `submit:false`, read the pane back, then issued the
empty `submit:true`; the pane rendered the exact marker and not the stale prefix. With `/model` open,
the UI retained `COLLIE_RULE_18110_MODAL_GUARD`, offered the explicit override, sent no `/reply` or
`/keys` write, and left the modal unchanged.

## OMP tool-approval corpus (captured 2026-09-10, oh-my-pi `omp` v18.1.17, herdr 0.9.0, two sandbox panes)

Three byte-faithful `pane.read format:ansi` captures from throwaway Herdr panes in
`/tmp/collie-omp-sandbox` (a `git init` repo), taken with `scripts/capture-fixture.sh`. They close the
gap `harness/omp/index.ts` named: the tool-approval dialog, which the omp adapter declined without
anyone ever having captured it.

**One sanitization pass, LENGTH-PRESERVING.** The operator's statusline is the final row and names
per-account quota. Two substitutions there, both same-length and with the SGR escape sequences left
untouched: every DIGIT becomes `0`, and the account labels become generic (`A`/`B`/`C`/`D` for the
Claude profiles, `codex1`/`codex2` for the Codex accounts). The row's byte length is unchanged — 1267
bytes before and after, all three files. Nothing else needed substitution: no username, hostname,
home path, session id or credential-shaped string appears in any of the three. LF throughout with no
trailing newline; their `wc -l` counts are 52, 48 and 48.

The dialog is a BOX AT COLUMN 0 that spans the pane, titled `Allow tool: <tool>`, with two option
rows (`Approve` then `Deny`) and an `up/down navigate  enter select  esc cancel` footer. Every row of
it opens with a Box Drawing character — `╭`, `│`, `╰` — which is what `markers.ts`'s `BOX_ROW` matches,
so `locateComposer` refuses the composer beneath it. That is the premise `omp/index.ts` had to infer
and these captures measure.

**The body fields are not fixed.** A bash approval gated by a config `approval: prompt` pattern
carries `Reason:` (naming the pattern) and `Command:`. A `write` approval gated by
`--approval-mode always-ask` carries `Path:` and `Content:`, and `Content:` runs onto its own row, so
a body field can be multi-line. `Reason:` appeared only on the pattern-gated capture, so it looks
tied to WHY approval was requested rather than to the tool — one example each, so that is a
hypothesis, not a finding.

| Fixture | State / what's in it | Herdr status |
|---|---|---|
| `omp--approval-bash.txt` | bash approval from a config pattern: `Reason: Prompt required by bash pattern: gh issue create *`, `Command: gh issue create --help`, Approve selected | `blocked` |
| `omp--approval-write.txt` | `write` approval under `--approval-mode always-ask`: `Path:` plus a multi-row `Content:`, Approve selected | `blocked` |
| `omp--approval-write--deny.txt` | The same screen with Deny selected. Three rows differ from the capture above: the two option rows, which swap the U+F054 marker, and the `Working…` spinner row, whose visible text is identical but whose SGR styling is not (the spinner was mid-animation) | `blocked` |

Keys live-probed on the real dialogs, not inferred. `y` is NOT a shortcut: the dialog was unchanged,
no character was typed anywhere, and the command did not run. `enter` selects the marked row — on the
bash dialog it approved and `gh issue create --help` then ran. `down` moves the U+F054 marker from
`Approve` to `Deny`, which is the entire difference between the two `write` captures. `esc` cancels —
probed on the `write` dialog, with the target file verified absent afterwards. One reproduction trap
worth recording: `read` is auto-approved even under `--approval-mode always-ask`, so a read call
paints no dialog and cannot be used to generate one.

## OMP `/tree` capture (2026-09-13, oh-my-pi `omp` v18.1.19, throwaway Herdr pane)

One byte-faithful `pane.read format:ansi` capture, and the only thing it is evidence for is that omp
has `/tree` and what omp paints for it. The harness bar's omp rows each name a capture, so the Tree
button waited on this file rather than on the argument that omp is a pi fork
([`harness-bar.ts`](../../lib/harness-bar.ts)).

omp 18.1.19 was installed into a throwaway prefix and run in `/tmp/fable-omp-sandbox`, a `git init`
repo. Its five-step first-run setup was skipped with `Escape`, so the session has **no model at all**
— the screen carries omp's own `No models available` warning. `/tree` still works, which is itself the
finding: the command is local to the TUI and needs no provider.

The screen is a box at column 0 titled `Session Tree`, with a long hint row
(`Enter: switch. Alt+↑/↓: previous/next turn. PgUp/PgDn (←/→): page. …`), a `Search:` row, a rule, and
then the filtered list, which here reads `1 entries hidden by the current filter [default]` over
`Press Alt+A to show all, Alt+D for default` and `(0/1)`. `Alt+A` was probed: it reveals the one entry
as `› • [thinking: high]` and flips the footer to `[all]`. `Alt+D` put the default filter back, and the
capture is that default state — what `/tree` paints on its own, with nothing driven after it.

CRLF throughout with no trailing newline; `wc -l` is 35. **No sanitization pass was needed**, and that
is verified rather than assumed: the file contains no username, hostname, home path, email, session id,
credential-shaped string or UUID, and the modal covers the statusline that would otherwise carry the
cwd. The session had no provider signed in, so there is no vendor account state to rewrite either.

| Fixture | State / what's in it | Herdr status |
|---|---|---|
| `omp--tree.txt` | The welcome panel and the `No models available` warning above a `╭─ Session Tree ─╮` box: hint row, `Search:` row, rule, then the default filter's `1 entries hidden` notice and `(0/1)` | `idle` |

`/tree` was dismissed with `Escape`; nothing in the tree was ever switched to.

## Lessons already encoded here (don't re-learn them)

- **Match on parsed text, not raw bytes**: SGR codes sit *between* glyphs (`❯` and `1.` are in
  different styled segments), so regexes over the raw buffer miss. Matchers run on
  `StyledLine`/segment text after `parseAnsi` (see `web/src/lib/blocks.ts`).
- **Chrome varies per install**: statusline is user-configured (this one shows
  `[Model] ctx:N% cwd … tokens`), hint footers differ per dialog kind, and a usage banner can sit
  above the input box. Don't anchor chrome detection to one exact string.
- **Menus are heterogeneous**: pointer rows (`❯ N.`), plain numbered rows, description sub-lines,
  and free-text escape rows ("Type something.", "Tell Claude what to change") all occur; footers
  are the most stable discriminator ("Enter to select/confirm", "Esc to cancel").


## agy corpus (captured 2026-08-26, Antigravity CLI 1.1.17, sandbox panes)

Byte-faithful `format:ansi` captures from running sandbox `agy` panes via `scripts/capture-fixture.sh <paneId> <name> 300`. Fastfetch system scrollback was trimmed, and all session identities were sanitized with length-preserving substitutions so row padding and column alignments stay byte-identical: account email (`developer.user@corp.test`) and session plan brain UUIDs (`00000000-0000-7000-8000-000000000000`).

AGY renders a framed input box bounded by horizontal rules (`─`), with status / hint lines below the bottom border (`? for shortcuts`, `esc to cancel`, model/effort metadata). Its dialogs use standard footers (`Enter to select · ↑/↓ to navigate`, `Tab to amend · Esc to cancel`, `Enter to confirm · Esc to cancel`, `ctrl+g to edit`).

| Fixture | State / what's in it | Herdr status |
|---|---|---|
| `agy--fresh-idle.txt` | Fresh session: Antigravity header logo and session info, idle input box between horizontal rules, statusline below (`? for shortcuts`) | `idle` |
| `agy--working.txt` | Mid-turn: tool calls, `⣾ Loading...` spinner with tip line, input box with `esc to cancel` status line | `working` |
| `agy--done.txt` | Completed turn: tool output, assistant summary, idle input box | `idle` |
| `agy--select-menu.txt` | AskUserQuestion single-select dialog: question, numbered options 1..3 with description sub-lines, free-text row "4. Write-in...", "↑/↓ Navigate · enter Select · esc Skip" footer | `blocked` |
| `agy--permission-bash.txt` | Bash execution permission dialog: command, "Requesting permission for: ls -la /tmp", options 1..4 (Yes / allow in conversation / persist / No), "↑/↓ Navigate · tab Amend · ctrl+g edit/expand command" footer | `blocked` |
| `agy--permission-edit.txt` | File edit / multi-line write permission dialog: multi-line heredoc preview, options 1..4, "↑/↓ Navigate · tab Amend · ctrl+g edit/expand command · ctrl+r Review" footer | `blocked` |
| `agy--trust-prompt.txt` | Workspace folder trust prompt: "Do you trust the contents of this project?", options "Yes, I trust this folder" / "No, exit", "↑/↓ Navigate · enter Confirm" footer | `blocked` |
| `agy--plan-approval.txt` | Plan approval dialog: plan question, options 1..3 (Execute plan / Request changes / Cancel) + "4. Write-in...", "↑/↓ Navigate · enter Select · esc Skip · ctrl+r Review" footer | `blocked` |


- **A free-text row's LABEL is not a stable marker**: it is the placeholder only while the box is
  empty. Type into the plan dialog's row 4 and the label becomes the user's own sentence. Its
  static `shift+tab to approve with this feedback` description is what identifies it in both
  states — and `❯` sitting on it means the field has focus, where every digit is swallowed as
  text rather than answering ([`PLAN_FEEDBACK_NOTES.md`](../../lib/grammar/PLAN_FEEDBACK_NOTES.md)).
  The row's DIGIT is install-dependent too (3 or 4), so it is read off the screen, never assumed.
