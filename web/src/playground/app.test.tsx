// The regression this pins: commit 52c08bb hoisted the app header out of the routes and onto a shelf
// above the router outlet (`RootLayout` in routes/root.tsx), so `<RouteHeader/>` now throws when
// mounted without an `<AppHeaderHost/>` above it — loud by design (app-header.tsx's `RouteHeader`).
// The unit suite got a wrapper for this (`test/header-host.tsx`), but the playground's OWN route
// fixtures (`PaneRouter`, `PaneStackRouter`, `PackRouter`, `SettingsRouter` in `playground/harness.tsx`)
// were never given the same treatment, so every card built on them rendered React Router's default
// "Unexpected Application Error!" boundary instead of the state it claimed to show — silently,
// because nothing here was tested.
//
// This test is cheap on purpose: mount the WHOLE playground once and assert no route's error
// boundary fired anywhere on the page. It does not re-derive what each card should look like (that's
// the "reach it for real" line on the card itself) — it only guards the property that broke, which
// is "the playground shows the state it claims to, not a crash".
//
// `createMemoryRouter` initialises asynchronously even with synchronous loaders (it always resolves
// through a promise-based navigation pipeline), so the routers commit their real content one or more
// microtasks after `render()` returns — a bare synchronous query would pass vacuously against the
// still-empty pre-init DOM, and different cards settle at different times depending on what else is
// mounted (composer effects, MSW-backed fetches). The test waits, per marker, with `findBy*` rather
// than asserting once after a single fixed anchor.
