// Fixture data for the states playground — a believable herd, four rosters, three panes, so the page
// shows what Collie looks like on a working day instead of on a two-row test snapshot.
//
// DEV-ONLY, like the rest of `src/playground/`: this module is only ever reached from
// `playground.html`, which is not a build input.
//
// ── The rules this file keeps ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//  1. **Every shape is the app's own type.** Nothing here is a loose object literal cast into place:
//     `AgentView`, `ServerSummary`, `PackStatusResponse`, `SessionSummary`, `UpdateInfo`,
//     `HostHealth`, `DevicesData` and `HomeData` are all imported and annotated, so a wire change
//     breaks this file at `tsc` rather than at a confusing render.
//
//  2. **It EXTENDS `@/test/handlers`, it does not replace it.** The test suite's fixtures are still
//     re-exported below and still used where a card wants to show exactly what a test asserts. The
//     richer set lives alongside them because a two-agent herd cannot show a four-section triage,
//     a nine-machine formation, or a "needs you" count that means anything.
//
//  3. **ONE clock anchor, {@link TS}, and every timestamp is expressed as an offset from it.** No
//     fixture calls `Date.now()` for itself. That matters twice over: the pack surfaces date their
//     `lastSeenAt` values against the snapshot's own `ts` (PACK_PROTOCOL.md §10.2), so a roster and
//     a census built off different anchors would disagree about the same machine; and the herd rows
//     render "how long ago" through `timeAgo`, so a scattered set of anchors would make two agents
//     that are meant to be four minutes apart read as four months apart.
//
//     The anchor is captured ONCE, at module load, from the wall clock — see the constant's own
//     note for why that is the right shape for a page and not a violation of the rule above.

/**
 * The lead's clock at "snapshot time" — the single anchor every timestamp in this file is an offset
 * from.
 *
 * It is read from the wall clock EXACTLY ONCE, when the module is first evaluated, and then frozen
 * for the life of the page. That is deliberate, and it is not the thing the "no `Date.now()` in
 * fixtures" rule forbids:
 *
 *  • The rule exists to stop a *drifting* set of anchors — twelve fixtures each calling `Date.now()`
 *    at their own moment, so ages that are supposed to be four minutes apart come out inconsistent,
 *    and a re-render moves a stamp that is meant to be still. One frozen constant has neither
 *    problem: `TS - 4 * MIN` is four minutes before `TS` on every render, forever.
 *
 *  • The pack surfaces date against the snapshot's own `ts` and would be happy with any fixed
 *    number. The HERD rows are not: `components/agent-card.tsx` renders its "since" through
 *    `timeAgo`, whose default `now` is the wall clock. Anchored to a hard-coded epoch, all fourteen
 *    agents would read "8 months ago" and the whole point of "varied since ages" would be lost.
 *
 * So: one wall-clock read, at the top of the file, named — and every fixture below measured from it.
