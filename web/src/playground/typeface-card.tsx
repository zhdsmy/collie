// The UI typeface comparison. DEV-ONLY, like everything else under src/playground/.
//
// WHY THIS CARD BREAKS THE PAGE'S "MOUNT THE REAL COMPONENT" RULE, ON PURPOSE. Every other card
// mounts real components with real props. This one cannot: the whole point is to see FOUR faces at
// once, and there is only ever one app. So the specimen below is a rebuild of the app's own chrome —
// the header's stacked identity, a section label, status chips, a settings row, buttons, and the
// counts-heavy list that is most of the dashboard — using the same sizes, weights, tracking and
// tokens the real components use. It is a stand-in, and it says so on the card.
//
// WHAT IT IS FOR — AND THIS CHANGED. It used to be the only place the call got made: F-D1 said the
// UI typeface was the maker's choice and shipped with no setting, so a face either won here or was
// never seen again. The setting exists now (ADR 0033), and the reader picks from the shipped list in
// Settings. So this card is no longer where the choice is MADE; it is where a candidate is
// AUDITIONED before it joins that list.
//
// That is a narrower job and a more useful one. Joining the shipped list is not free — a face costs
// a subset in build-ui-font.sh, a computed fallback twin, an @font-face in index.css, an entry in
// UI_FONT_URLS and a translated note in six dictionaries. This page is where you find out whether a
// face is worth all of that, at real sizes, against the faces already there. Judge it at the 11px
// uppercase tracked label — which the header's own brand line now wears — and at the 16px
// multiplexer line beside the mark, on a phone, in BOTH themes — that is where these
// faces actually differ. The counts column is there because the dashboard is full of "14m", "(6)",
// "p1", and a face whose figures are proportional makes that column jitter row to row.
//
// The shipped faces (Space Grotesk, Aldrich, Geist) resolve through index.css, so what you compare here is
// the same bytes the app renders. The AUDITIONS are declared in playground.css instead: index.css
// names exactly what the service worker caches (lib/sw-routes.ts UI_FONT_URLS), and it must not grow
// entries for files a shipped build never asks for.
//
// THE SWITCHER IS NOW THE PAGE'S OWN. The choice lives in ./prefs.ts and dresses the ENTIRE
// playground — every real component on the page inherits the face, which is the honest way to feel
// a candidate's impact. This card keeps the side-by-side specimen and the commentary; the sidebar's
// Typeface control is the same store with the words left out.
