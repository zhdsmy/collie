// the boot splash all derive from it so they can never disagree. That is also why this page cannot
// show "troubled" and "lost" side by side — there is a single anchor, and two different answers to
// "how long since the last live poll" cannot both be true at once. Forking the components to take
// the state as a prop would break the very property the clock exists to guarantee.
//
// So the playground drives the real store instead, with the real exported mutators, and every
// clock-fed state on the page moves together. Flipping the control in the sidebar is exactly what a
// real outage does — which makes "do the bar and the dog agree?" the easy thing to check.
//
// THE CONTROL IS GLOBAL, NOT SECTION-LOCAL, and that follows from the same fact: there is one store,
// so a control parked inside "Boot & connection" would silently be repainting the header dog three
// sections further down as well. A sidebar control tells the truth about its own reach.
