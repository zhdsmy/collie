// point at HEAD" alone is not enough: a checkout can legitimately hold no tags at all and still be
// a release. There are three shapes, and `channelFor` (vite-icons.ts) is the pure decision over
// them:
//
//   1. no git at all (a tarball or packaged build) -> release
//   2. git works, but the checkout holds NO tags at all -> release. This is the shallow, detached
//      checkout `herdr plugin install` leaves (cli/update.ts's header, around line 67): `git init`
//      + `fetch --depth 1` + `checkout --detach`, so it never fetched a tag either way. `collie
//      update` fetches tags properly later (cli/update.ts, ~700-735), but until then an empty tag
//      list here is normal for a genuine release install, not evidence of a dev tree.
//   3. git works and tags exist -> a real dev checkout, so the version's own tag decides: its
//      commit matching HEAD means release, anything else (including a missing tag for this
//      version) means dev. This is the case a dev lane on an untagged `chore(release):` commit
//      used to get wrong, building as release before its tag existed.
