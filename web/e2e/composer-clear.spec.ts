// THE BELT'S X, in a real engine (M40 spec 04, issue #291). While the phone's box holds a draft, an
// icon-only X stands on the belt's pinned block, directly left of the Changes pill. One tap empties
// the box and the stored draft and sends nothing to the pane; the same slot then shows Undo, and a
// tap on Undo puts the draft back. Three promises here are ones jsdom cannot keep for us:
//
//  * The keyboard stays up. The field keeps focus through both taps, because the button refuses its
//    own `mousedown` (not `pointerdown`, which costs WebKit the click: actions-row.tsx says why).
//    That is an engine's focus rule, so it is asked of Chromium and WebKit.
//  * Nothing moves. The X arrives over the scroller's end and the scrolling pills stay where they
//    were; the pinned pills are anchored right and stay too; the X and Undo share one box.
//  * The pane hears nothing. Not a key, not a reply: the clear is the phone's own business.
//
// Runs under every `app-*` project, so Chromium and WebKit answer the same questions.

// NO SERVICE WORKER, for the reason `e2e/issue-180.spec.ts` states at length: `page.route` cannot
// see a request the worker makes on the page's behalf, so a worker that claims the page part way
// through a case takes `/api/*` away from the fixture. Measured here on 2026-09-27 under WebKit, 20
// of 20 runs with 8 workers: the second poll went past the fixture to the preview server's proxy
// (`playwright.config.ts` says where that led), the pane read came back `pane_not_found`, and the app
// left `/pane/w1:p1` for the dashboard in the middle of the case. One worker at a time, 10 of 10
// passed: a case that ends before the worker's claim never sees it, which is why it read as a flake.
// The worker has its own case, in `e2e/smoke.spec.ts`.
