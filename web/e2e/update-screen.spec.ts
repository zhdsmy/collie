// THE UPDATE IN PROGRESS TAKES THE SCREEN, IN A REAL BROWSER (M28/01, update mode since ADR 0064).
//
// Two cases over the one path no unit test can reach. The reducer's own cross-product is pinned in
// `src/lib/update-screen.test.ts`, and the sheet's DOM in `src/components/update-screen.test.tsx`;
// what only a browser can show is the three things that are not functions of an input:
//
//   1. `inert` on the wrapper in `App.tsx` actually takes the app behind out of reach;
//   2. the file count on this device's own row comes off a REAL service-worker precache of a REAL new
//      bundle, one message per completed asset (`src/sw.ts`);
//   3. the page reloads ONCE, on the controller swap, and the document that boots reopens update mode
//      on Done, because the claim outlived the page. `update-screen.spec.ts` measures the panel's boxes.
//
// THE SWAP SERVER, NOT `vite preview`. The bundle has to change under a browser that is already
// running one, which is what `e2e/serve-builds.ts` is for, and a swap is destructive to every other
// case on the origin — a service worker's scope is an ORIGIN, so the second port is the only clean
// separation. The same reasoning as `e2e/service-worker.spec.ts`, whose shape this file follows.
//
// THE RUN IS A FAKE API AND NOTHING ELSE. `POST /api/update` on a real bridge detaches a process that
// rebuilds and restarts the host; a browser case must never be the thing that does that. So the run
// record is a variable in this file, walked through its states by the case, and `GET /api/update/check`
// plus `GET /standby/update` both report it. That is exactly what the phone sees.

// ── UPDATE MODE: NOTHING IN THE PANEL MOVES (ADR 0064) ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Altan's rule for the build, after the drawn options shifted between "Members, one unreachable" and
// "Phone downloading": nothing in the panel moves between any two states. The mechanism is fixed
// boxes (`components/update-screen.tsx`'s header); this is the measurement. It walks one update
// through every state a real bundle can be put in, at 375x812, and after each one reads the box of
// the heading, the subtitle, every row, the note and the footer, and compares it with the first
// screen, "Ready to start", to half a pixel.
//
// It runs in Chromium (`app-phone`) AND in WebKit (`app-phone-webkit`, always in CI, `make
// e2e-webkit` on this Fedora host), because Safari is where the phone opens Collie and it disagrees
// with Chromium on geometry a unit test never sees. In an engine whose worker does not install here,
// step 6 takes the no-worker path, a plain reload, and lands on the same Done screen; the download
// state is measured when it happens.
//
// It moves the one served-directory pointer of the swap server, like the three cases above and every
// case in service-worker.spec.ts. Being in this file does not keep it apart from those: the WebKit
// walk is another project and service-worker.spec.ts another file, so each case holds the swap
// server's lock (`holdSwapServer`, taken in the file's `beforeEach`) for as long as it runs.

// THE LARGE-TEXT WALK. Android's font scale and a browser's text size raise the root font size, and
// every box in the panel is in rem, so the panel must grow as one piece: same no-shift rule, nothing
// spilling out of its box, and the panel still below the band. 150% is where a px box used to spill.
