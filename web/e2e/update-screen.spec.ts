// THE UPDATE IN PROGRESS TAKES THE SCREEN, IN A REAL BROWSER (M28/01).
//
// Two cases over the one path no unit test can reach. The reducer's own cross-product is pinned in
// `src/lib/update-screen.test.ts`, and the sheet's DOM in `src/components/update-screen.test.tsx`;
// what only a browser can show is the three things that are not functions of an input:
//
//   1. `inert` on the wrapper in `App.tsx` actually takes the app behind out of reach;
//   2. the file count on this device's own row comes off a REAL service-worker precache of a REAL new
//      bundle, one message per completed asset (`src/sw.ts`);
//   3. the page reloads ONCE, on the controller swap, and the toast that follows names the version.
//
// THE SWAP SERVER, NOT `vite preview`. The bundle has to change under a browser that is already
// running one, which is what `e2e/serve-builds.ts` is for, and a swap is destructive to every other
// case on the origin — a service worker's scope is an ORIGIN, so the second port is the only clean
// separation. The same reasoning as `e2e/service-worker.spec.ts`, whose shape this file follows.
//
// THE RUN IS A FAKE API AND NOTHING ELSE. `POST /api/update` on a real bridge detaches a process that
// rebuilds and restarts the host; a browser case must never be the thing that does that. So the run
// record is a variable in this file, walked through its states by the case, and `GET /api/update/check`
// plus `GET /standby/update` both report it. That is exactly what the phone sees.
