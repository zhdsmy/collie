# Adding a harness adapter

Collie up-levels an agent's terminal dialogs (permission prompts, AskUserQuestion menus, plan
approvals, …) into native phone buttons. The per-agent knowledge that makes this safe lives in a
**harness adapter**. Claude Code is the one verified adapter today; this is how you add another
(codex, pi, opencode, …).

Read first: [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) (the interaction loop + security model),
[`HERDR_API.md`](./HERDR_API.md) (the verified socket + `pane.send_keys` key grammar), and
[`web/src/fixtures/panes/README.md`](./web/src/fixtures/panes/README.md) (the fixture corpus).

## Architecture in one paragraph

An adapter is a [`HarnessAdapter`](./web/src/lib/harness/types.ts) —
`{ agent, buildBlocks, extractStatusLines, extractInputDraft }` — registered by its Herdr `agent`
string in [`web/src/lib/harness/registry.ts`](./web/src/lib/harness/registry.ts). The registry is the
single decision site for "which agents get grammars"; every agent absent from it keeps the universal
raw terminal mirror. Claude is the reference adapter, under
[`web/src/lib/harness/claude/`](./web/src/lib/harness/claude/): its detectors (prompt-select, wizard,
preview-select, chrome, markers) are **pure functions over `StyledLine[]`** — no pane access, no
network. Detection only says "this dialog is on screen"; the keystroke recipes and the race-guard
that actually types live elsewhere. [`guard.ts`](./web/src/lib/harness/guard.ts) is the **only** module
in `harness/` allowed to touch the network (it re-fetches the pane before a guarded keystroke) — a
**capability fence** (see below) enforces that every other harness module stays I/O-pure, because a
socket call types into a live terminal.

## Fixtures-first workflow

Detectors are developed and gated entirely against **byte-faithful pane captures** — never guessed
from screenshots. The loop:

1. In a **sandbox pane** (a scratch agent, never a real work session), drive the agent into the dialog
   state you want to lift.
2. Capture it byte-for-byte:
   ```sh
   scripts/capture-fixture.sh <paneId> <name>   # paneIds: GET /api/snapshot
   ```
   The capture is real terminal output and **this repo is public** — review every file for secrets
   before `git add` (`less -R`), per
   [`web/src/fixtures/panes/README.md`](./web/src/fixtures/panes/README.md).
3. Write a **pure detector** over `StyledLine[]` and test it against the fixture through the real
   `parseAnsi → splitLines` pipeline (copy the shape of
   [`claude/prompt-select.test.ts`](./web/src/lib/harness/claude/prompt-select.test.ts)). Anchor
   detection on the **buffer tail** — a dialog that has scrolled up (real output below it) must not
   match. That tail invariant is the core false-positive guard.

## The capability tier ladder

An adapter earns capability incrementally. Ship a lower tier first; each is independently useful.

- **Tier 0 — raw mirror.** Every agent gets this for free: the colored terminal mirror + slash palette
  + special-keys pad. No adapter needed. It already works.
- **Tier 1 — read-only lift.** Chrome/status/draft extraction (`extractStatusLines`,
  `extractInputDraft`) plus **detection of a NEW, not-yet-wired block kind** — recognised and drawn,
  but with no keystroke recipe behind it, so taps send **no keystrokes**. Mergeable **from fixtures
  alone**: a mis-parse only costs cosmetics because there is no send path to fire into a terminal.
  **Caveat:** this holds only for a brand-new kind. If your adapter emits an EXISTING interactive kind
  (`prompt-select` / `wizard` / `multi-select`), its keystroke recipe is already live, so those taps
  go hot the moment your detector matches — that is automatically **Tier 2** and must clear the full
  Tier-2 bar below (corpus, notes, conformance, live-verification), not the read-only one.
- **Tier 2 — interactive.** Wiring taps to keystrokes (the buttons go hot). This is the bar that types
  into a real shell, so it requires **all** of:
  - a **dated fixture corpus** covering the dialog's states,
  - a **choreography notes file** documenting the verified keystroke recipe (à la
    [`web/src/lib/grammar/WIZARD_NOTES.md`](./web/src/lib/grammar/WIZARD_NOTES.md)),
  - a green **`describeAdapterConformance`** run (the CI gate, below), and
  - **maintainer live-verification against a real pane** before the send path is enabled.

Codex intentionally stops at Tier 1: its adapter extracts chrome, status, and drafts, but does not
lift interactive dialogs.

### The fail-closed contract (non-negotiable)

**A detector MUST return `null` on anything it does not confidently recognise.** A partial lift is a
bug, not a nicety — it types a keystroke into a live terminal. When in doubt, fall back to the raw
mirror; the user can always drive Tier 0 by hand. Never up-level a dialog you can't fully model (e.g.
a menu numbered past 9, whose option would need the unsendable key `"10"` — bail to raw instead).

## Menus (generic modals)

Not every modal is a dialog you can model. A **menu** is the last-resort shape: a full-screen picker
(Claude's `/model` and its kin) with no numbered-option recipe, driven entirely by the keys the screen
printed in **its own footer** — `Enter to set as default · s to use this session only · Esc to cancel`.
Lifting one is what stops a composer send typing the user's reply into the picker.

The model and the derivation are **harness-neutral**, so an adapter implements menus by following
types, not by reading Claude's code:

- [`harness/menu-model.ts`](./web/src/lib/harness/menu-model.ts) — `MenuModel` / `MenuAction` /
  `MenuNav` (the `menu` Block's payload; the renderer and the race guard know only these).
- [`harness/menu-hints.ts`](./web/src/lib/harness/menu-hints.ts) — the shared derivation:
  `parseKeyHintFooter`, the key-token whitelist `menuKeyFor`, label capitalisation, the `←/→ to
  <verb>` row grammar, and the arrow key constants.
- [`harness/claude/menu.ts`](./web/src/lib/harness/claude/menu.ts) — the reference implementation.
  It contributes only Claude's own conventions: where the region starts, its tail anchor, and the
  input-box gate.

What your adapter must satisfy (all pinned by `describeAdapterConformance`):

1. Every action key comes from `menuKeyFor` — the screen's own footer, nothing inferred. The only
   additions are the arrows the screen **advertised** (a highlight row for Up/Down, an `←/→ to <verb>`
   row for Left/Right, whose leading text is the live value the arrows adjust).
2. **Never a digit**, however tempting the numbered rows look —
   [ADR 0009](./.adr/0009-a-generic-menu-is-driven-by-the-keys-it-names.md) records why (in `/model`
   a digit confirms *and* rewrites the user's default).
3. A non-empty `signature` over the region that **changes when the region's text does** — Herdr's
   `revision` is a stub, so it is the entire race guard (the generic one — see the next section).
4. Menu detection runs **last**, after every specific grammar you have, and must decline a screen with
   a live input box; your `composerReady` must answer `false` while the modal is up.

## Every dialog model is a contract, and the race guard is generic

Menus were the first grammar written this way; **all five now are**. Each block kind's payload lives
in its own harness-neutral module — [`prompt-model.ts`](./web/src/lib/harness/prompt-model.ts),
[`wizard-model.ts`](./web/src/lib/harness/wizard-model.ts),
[`preview-model.ts`](./web/src/lib/harness/preview-model.ts),
[`multi-select-model.ts`](./web/src/lib/harness/multi-select-model.ts),
[`menu-model.ts`](./web/src/lib/harness/menu-model.ts) — alongside the **identity comparators** that
say when two derivations are the same dialog. Those comparators are part of the contract, not an
implementation detail: their per-kind nuances (a menu ARROW ignores the `←/→` label it is about to
change; the multi-select Submit walk ignores the pointer it moves but *not* a checkbox flipped by a
second device; the preview note flow ignores the note it is editing) are what keeps a guarded tap
from being either unsafe or unusable. [`dialog-contract.ts`](./web/src/lib/harness/dialog-contract.ts)
is the table that wires kind → `{commits, identity, signature, region}`.

The consequence for you: **you write no race guard.** One generic guard
([`lib/dialog-guard.ts`](./web/src/lib/dialog-guard.ts)) re-derives the fresh pane through
`adapterFor(agent).buildBlocks` — your pipeline, not anyone's detector — and compares through the
kind's contract before a key goes out. Emit a block kind and its guard, its renderer and its
conformance invariants come with it; there is nothing per-harness left to implement, and nothing in
`lib/` may import a `detect*` function again.

What that costs you is one promise per model, pinned by `describeAdapterConformance`: a **non-empty
signature that moves when a row the dialog was derived from changes** (Herdr's `revision` is a stub —
this is the entire freshness check), and a non-empty region text that is literally on screen (the
bridge binds the write to it).

## The two gates

- **CI gate — the conformance suite.**
  [`web/src/lib/harness/conformance.ts`](./web/src/lib/harness/conformance.ts) exports
  `describeAdapterConformance(adapter, { ownFixtures, foreignFixtures, neutralFixtures })`. Call it
  from your adapter's `*.test.ts` (see
  [`conformance.test.ts`](./web/src/lib/harness/conformance.test.ts)). It asserts: conservative
  detection (raw-only on foreign + neutral buffers), tail-anchoring (a dialog lifts only
  at the tail), the menu contract above (for any fixture that lifts one), the dialog-model contract
  (for every kind you up-level: signature non-empty, text-sensitive, and its comparators agreeing —
  a perturbed screen must fail the committing comparison), the composer-region pairing (if you supply
  the optional `composerPrompt` — the on-screen row a destructive write is bound to via
  `expected_prompt` — it must name a region on exactly the screens your `composerReady` approves), and
  key-grammar validity (every emittable keystroke passes `isValidHerdrKey` — the
  verified `pane.send_keys` grammar: single-digit only, `ctrl+c` not `C-c`, no
  `PageUp`/`Home`/`End`/`Delete`).
- **Safety gate — the capability fence.** The live enforcement is
  [`web/src/lib/harness/fence.test.ts`](./web/src/lib/harness/fence.test.ts): it fails the build if any
  module under `harness/` except `guard.ts` imports the network API (`@/lib/api` or a relative
  `…/api`), matching the specifier anywhere in the file so a Prettier line-wrapped import can't slip
  through. It runs under `bun run test` (which the pre-push hook runs). The `no-restricted-imports`
  rule in [`web/eslint.config.mjs`](./web/eslint.config.mjs) encodes the same fence but is
  **aspirational** — no ESLint runner is wired yet, so it does not execute; the test is the real gate.

Run both — and the full suite — with `cd web && bun run test`; typecheck with `bunx tsc --noEmit`.
