# Changelog

This file tracks all notable changes to Collie, ordered newest version first. The project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). From 1.6.0 on, a version's changes are grouped under
`### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Fixed`, `### Packaging` and `### Docs`, in that order and only
where there is content, and every bullet opens with a short bold lead sentence, which is the line
the GitHub Release page prints. Older versions carry a single flat list. Every entry links to its commit and credits the contributor where there is one. The
`## [Unreleased]` section contains merged work waiting for release. The release
commit renames this heading to `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD`, adds the commit hashes, and adds a new
empty `## [Unreleased]` section above it. The newest numbered `## [x.y.z]` heading (excluding the
Unreleased heading) **must** match the `version` field in `herdr-plugin.toml`, `package.json`,
and `web/package.json`, which `scripts/check-version.sh` checks. See [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) →
*Versioning* for the bump policy.

## Upgrading

**Already on 1.x?** Run `collie update`, or run
`herdr plugin action invoke update --plugin herdr.collie`. Check the result with
`bin/collie version` (or `herdr plugin action invoke version --plugin herdr.collie`). It shows the
newest tag. The phone PWA updates itself within about a minute; no reload needed.
Running a crew? Update the lead first; members follow on their own. Details:
`docs/crew.md` → *Updating from 1.7.0*.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Follow upstream 1.18.0 while keeping the compact Collie controls.** Adopt authenticated reads, secret masking, offline copies and action locks, left-hand layout, file previews and links, branch launchers, new locales and harness fixes; preserve downstream cards, fonts and direct typing. Clear recent Codex models on unpair and establish live reads in the canary. See [the integration report](docs/upstream-v1.18.0.md).

## [1.17.2+collie.4] - 2026-10-08

### Added

- **Codex questions, plans and reviews are answered from cards again.** A question card switches
  between questions, confirms each answer, waits for every earlier answer before Submit all, and
  takes notes in the card. The Plan card shows the plan with its three choices always on screen,
  and the review card picks a base branch or commit. All three follow Codex 0.160.1 and were
  pressed live. The one-digit question card from 1.17.2+collie.3 gives way to the full card, and asynchronous
  questions stay in the terminal. ([e8afc607](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/e8afc607))

## [1.17.2+collie.3] - 2026-10-07

### Added

- **Codex questions are answered from a card again.** A `request_user_input` question shows its
  options as buttons, in the Terminal and Chat views, and each button sends that option's digit
  once: Codex records the answer and moves to the next question, or submits on the last. The notes
  box, Esc (it interrupts the turn) and asynchronous questions stay in the terminal.
  ([3d761804](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/3d761804))

## [1.17.2+collie.2] - 2026-10-07

### Fixed

- **Rejoin wrapped lines also joins a reply's short last row.** The last row of a paragraph, such as
  a lone `rule.`, held too few letters to prove the wrap, and the check read on past the blank row
  into the turn's own chrome, which no session log holds; that row kept its break and its hanging
  indent. The check now stops at a blank row, and one full side of context is enough.
  ([6303aea1](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/6303aea1))

## [1.17.2+collie.1] - 2026-10-07

### Fixed

- **Prompt cards show their context and Claude drafts stay editable.** Merge upstream v1.17.2, including v1.17.1: restore permission subjects, avoid duplicate questions, and follow Claude Code 2.1.291 menus, effort levels and plan dialogs while retaining Collie controls and native Codex cards. See [the complete Chinese report](docs/upstream-v1.17.2.md). ([da2e8f5b](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/da2e8f5b))

## [1.17.0+collie.5] - 2026-10-06

### Fixed

- **Chat shows Codex's Plan, review and Warnings screens in a card.** Chat draws no terminal, so these native screens were invisible there. Each now gets the unread-dialog card with Esc as its way back, and in Chat the card carries the screen itself; the terminal view keeps the native rows with the compact card under them. The warning count opens the Warnings panel again in Chat. A Codex question gets no card, because Esc on it interrupts the whole turn. ([3e72a140](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/3e72a140))

## [1.17.0+collie.4] - 2026-10-06

### Fixed

- **In Chat, Codex's warning count points to the terminal view.** Tapping it used to open Codex's Warnings pager, which Chat does not draw, leaving Codex in a screen nobody could see and refusing the next reply. The count still shows; the tap now says to switch to Terminal view. ([73d52499](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/73d52499))

## [1.17.0+collie.3] - 2026-10-06

### Fixed

- **Swiping the key row no longer presses a key.** A touch that drifts past a few pixels or scrolls the row is a swipe: it sends no key, and an arrow under it never starts repeating. ([609165c0](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/609165c0))

## [1.17.0+collie.2] - 2026-10-06

### Fixed

- **Codex's selected list row stays readable on a phone.** Under Herdr, Codex highlights the selected row in reverse video. Collie read that as a submitted-message band and dropped its fill, which left the chosen option as dark text on the dark mirror. ([376e8ab3](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/376e8ab3))

## [1.17.0+collie.1] - 2026-10-06

### Changed

- **Merge upstream v1.17.0.** Add Files browsing, machine monitoring, dashboard ordering and default Chat; retain Collie compact controls, cards, wrap joining and notification behavior. See [the complete Chinese report](docs/upstream-v1.17.0.md). ([13eb99bb](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/13eb99bb))

## [1.16.2+collie.1] - 2026-10-04

### Fixed

- **Phone scrolling, Claude replies and dialog taps follow upstream fixes.** Merge v1.16.2 with iPhone pane scrolling, complete long Claude pastes, model-switch confirmation, opencode overlay handling and prompt refresh after key writes; retain Collie layouts, input guards and existing agent adaptations. ([47624fa5](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/47624fa5))

## [1.16.1+collie.1] - 2026-10-04

### Fixed

- **Finished alerts and OMP input follow the latest upstream fixes.** Merge v1.16.1 to notify on working-to-idle completion, recognise OMP claude and borderless composers, and correct Windows tool lookup and doctor guidance; retain Collie notification acknowledgement and existing card layouts. ([c265ab8f](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/c265ab8f))

## [1.16.0+collie.1] - 2026-10-03

### Changed

- **Collie follows upstream with safer dialogs and more agent integrations.** Merge v1.16.0 with Oh My Pi cards, Muse history, optional local transcription and Access verification, plus experimental Windows support; preserve Collie layouts, direct-input controls and current agent adaptations. ([1e9f05d1](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/1e9f05d1))

## [1.15.3+collie.7] - 2026-10-03

### Changed

- **Type into terminal now arms with a draft in the box.** It used to refuse until the draft was
  sent or cleared. The draft, chips included, now waits out of sight and untouched while the keys go
  to the terminal, the strip says "draft kept", and Stop puts it back. Nothing of it is sent.
  ([3bd7e51c](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/3bd7e51c))

## [1.15.3+collie.6] - 2026-10-03

### Fixed

- **The modifier tag on the Type keys' page switch no longer covers its icon.** The three page dots
  moved from under the icon to beside it, which lets the icon sit centred and leaves the top corner
  free for the tag, even with Ctrl, Alt and Shift all latched.
  ([266f2f70](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/266f2f70))

## [1.15.3+collie.5] - 2026-10-03

### Fixed

- **A latched Ctrl, Shift or Alt shows on every Type keys page.** The modifier keys live on the
  first page only, yet a latched one still applies to what the phone keyboard types on the combos
  and F-key pages, where it used to be invisible: a stray Ctrl turned a typed `d` into Ctrl+D. The
  page switch now carries it as a small filled tag, and its spoken name says which.
  ([6ecfcd89](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/6ecfcd89))

## [1.15.3+collie.4] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- **The Type keys gain a page of common combos.** Shift+Tab, Shift+Left and Ctrl+C now sit one tap
  away, between the navigation keys and the rarely used F1 to F12. Each goes out whole: a latched
  Ctrl or Shift neither applies to it nor is spent on it. The page switch now shows the icon of the
  page you are on, with three dots marking which page it is.
  ([05ba5ca9](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/05ba5ca9))

### Fixed

- **A question Claude asks in Chinese or Japanese is a card again.** AskUserQuestion's question is
  the model's own words, so in those languages it ends on the full-width `？`, and the question
  search accepted only `?`: the whole dialog fell to the unread card and its options could not be
  tapped. Both question searches now accept either mark; a real Claude Code 2.1.287 capture pins it.
  ([669a4dce](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/669a4dce))

## [1.15.3+collie.3] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- **An experiment rejoins the lines an agent's terminal wrapped.** Claude Code and Codex break prose
  at their own pane width, so a phone wrapped every row a second time and a paragraph read as a full
  row, a stub and an indented continuation. Turn on *Rejoin wrapped lines* under Settings →
  Experiments and the mirror joins a row break wherever the agent's session log proves it was a
  wrap, keeping list items, author line breaks, tool output and frames as drawn. The pane's Display
  sheet then holds the switch. Joining is render-only, so find, links and copy still see the screen
  as read, and a reply still being written keeps its breaks until it reaches the log.
  ([a7873453](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/a7873453))

## [1.15.3+collie.2] - 2026-10-02

### Changed

- **Retired card code no longer adds to adaptation maintenance.** Remove the unused Codex question-card parser and duplicate dialog frame, retain native-question regression coverage, and refresh current card scope and panel documentation. ([1035f76a](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/1035f76a))

## [1.15.3+collie.1] - 2026-10-02

### Changed

- **Collie follows upstream with reliable paths and Crew connections.** Merge v1.15.3 with Windows path fixes, explicit Crew addresses and omp empty-editor hint recognition, preserving Collie controls and current agent adaptations. ([4e24f2d5](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/4e24f2d5))
## [1.18.0] - 2026-10-08

### Added

- **A left-hand layout.** Settings → Appearance → Hand turns the pane screen round for a left thumb.
  The belt mirrors: the Switch button, Changes and the X stand at its left end, still above Send, and
  Keys is the rightmost pill with the harness shortcuts scrolling off toward the left. Send and Attach
  sit left of the reply box. Pills still read icon then word, and the tab order is unchanged. The
  default is Right, and the right-hand layout is untouched. ([5a51c13e](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/5a51c13e))
- **Paths the agent prints are links.** A file path in the chat, on an Edit, Write or Read card, or in
  the terminal mirror opens that file in Files, at the line when the path names one (`src/a.ts:42`).
  The phone resolves the path against the pane's repo; a path outside it stays plain text, and only a
  root-relative path ever reaches the bridge, and a path becomes a link only once the bridge has
  confirmed the file is there, one batched check per view. On a crew member's pane paths stay plain
  text (ADR 0088). ([d9cb1ec9](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d9cb1ec9))
- **A second agent on a branch.** A pane's menu offers "New agent on a branch": the branch name is
  prefilled, pick one of your launchers or a shell, and Collie creates a git worktree and starts the
  session in it beside the first. Each create carries a request id and the bridge keeps a receipt, so
  a retry after a lost answer never makes two worktrees. Herdr only, on the lead (ADR 0089). ([d9cb1ec9](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d9cb1ec9))
- **Collie speaks five more languages.** Русский, Italiano, Français, Português (Brazilian wording) and
  Türkçe join the language list in Settings → Appearance, so the interface has twelve. Russian reads
  every count in its own form: 1 файл, 2 файла, 5 файлов, 21 файл. ([637280e4](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/637280e4))
- **A paired device can carry an expiry you chose.** `collie pair --expires 30d` (also `h`, `w`)
  puts a lifetime on the token the phone claims. Without the flag a token never expires, exactly as
  before, and no existing token changes. `collie devices set-expiry` and `clear-expiry` adjust a
  paired device by label, `devices list` and the Settings screen show each expiry, and an expired
  token is refused as `device expired` so the phone offers **Pair again**. An expired device still
  keeps pairing on until you revoke it. Pairing again under the expired device's name replaces it
  and revokes its old token in the same write; a name a live device holds is still refused. ([e1a8e93e](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/e1a8e93e))
- **Known secret shapes are masked before pane text leaves the machine.** API keys with a
  known prefix, JWTs, PEM private keys, bearer tokens and `password=`-style values become `•` marks
  of the same width on the bridge, so the mirror, the Chat and History views and every push
  notification carry the mask, never the key. A mitigation, not a guarantee: plain passwords and
  bare hex are not matched. `COLLIE_REDACT=off` turns it off. Push bodies now name a pane by the
  label you gave it, never by the program's own title. File bodies in Files and diffs in Changes
  are masked the same way, and so is every text of a tool call in Chat and History, its paths and
  a question's options and answers included. ([f3365bbf](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/f3365bbf))
- **Stricter response headers, a private blob cache and a pair rate limit.** Every answer now
  carries a `Permissions-Policy` that denies camera, location, payment and USB and keeps the
  microphone for hands-free speech; the content policy adds `object-src 'none'` and
  `form-action 'self'`; HSTS is sent when the request arrived over HTTPS. Pane images under
  `/api/blobs` are no longer cached by the browser (they were public for a year). `/api/pair` refuses
  more than ten attempts per source address per minute with `429`. ([5f257d3a](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/5f257d3a))
- **Unpairing wipes what the pairing left on the phone.** One wipe routine clears the token, every
  draft, the saved pane text, the push subscription and the runtime caches when you unpair, when
  the bridge revokes or expires the device, and (for one pane only) when a password prompt shows.
  Settings and the app shell stay. Before it wipes, the phone confirms the refusal with one more
  call, and a wipe cut short resumes on the next open. Revoking a device now asks once more and
  says what is cleared, and the pair screen names the cause afterwards. "Clear saved copies now"
  in Settings → Device empties the store by hand. ([e52c8851](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/e52c8851))
- **The phone keeps session content in one store.** The last herd snapshot and the last pane text
  move from the tab's session storage into one IndexedDB database with a 24-hour lifetime, a
  256 KiB cap per pane and a 10 MiB cap in all, purged on open and deleted whole on unpair
  (ADR 0087). A cold open can read it back; nothing in it can trigger an action. Without IndexedDB
  the store falls back to memory for the session. ([e52c8851](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/e52c8851))
- **Read a session offline.** The phone keeps the newest Chat turns of each pane on the device
  (Settings → Device → "Keep chat on this phone": off, 1 day, 7 days; 1 day is the default) and
  reads them back when the bridge does not answer, under "Saved copy from {time}". A cold open with
  no bridge shows the saved herd, dimmed, with every status in the past tense and "as of {time}" in
  the header. The banner tells you whether the phone is offline or the bridge is unreachable. The
  raw terminal mirror is never kept as chat, and a password prompt drops that pane's saved turns.
  A failed poll never drops what is on screen: the view keeps its content, dims it and dates it.
  A poll waits at most 6 seconds, one second longer than the bridge waits for the multiplexer, so a
  phone whose VPN is up but whose radio is off learns within one poll that the bridge is gone. The
  banner then says either "You are offline" or "No connection to the bridge"; the phone cannot tell
  a dead internet from a dead Tailscale, so it no longer guesses. ([6e02b31b](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/6e02b31b))
- **Nothing saved on the phone can act.** While the last read of a pane failed, the phone is
  offline, or the screen is a saved copy, dialog options and the send button are disabled with
  "Reconnect to answer" and "Reconnect to send". Typing still works and the draft still saves.
  There is no queue, no retry and no send on reconnect. ([6e02b31b](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/6e02b31b))
- **Files shows pictures.** A PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP or AVIF opens as the picture, fitted to the
  screen on a checkerboard that shows transparency, with its size and type under it. An SVG gets a
  Source | Preview control and opens on Preview, drawn as a picture that runs no script. A README's
  relative pictures draw in its preview. The bridge reads the type from the file's bytes, never its
  name, and serves up to 16 MiB; anything else keeps the "Binary file" line with the reason (ADR 0090). A picture
  you open again draws from memory until the file changes or you tap refresh. ([e7c82688](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/e7c82688))
- **Send now on a waiting message.** When you queue a message while Claude Code works, Chat's
  "Waiting to send" card gets a **Send now** button. It presses Ctrl+Enter, which hands the whole
  queue to the running turn at its next tool call. The bridge declares the key for each harness, and
  only Claude Code declares one today, so no other pane shows the button. It shows only where the
  multiplexer can send Ctrl+Enter, which today is Herdr: tmux and zellij deliver it as a plain Enter,
  which would send your draft instead. A read-only device, a saved copy and a pane the bridge cannot
  reach do not show it either. ([3281c35b](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/3281c35b))
- **A crew lead masks its members' text too.** The lead masks a member's mirror, Chat, History,
  diffs, file text and pane titles with its own mask before your phone gets them, so a member still
  on 1.17.x cannot send a key in clear. Text a member already masked comes through unchanged. An
  answer the lead cannot read to mask is refused, never passed on raw. A copy the phone got before
  the lead masked it is fetched again, not kept on a `304`. ([d54c626d](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d54c626d))
- **Every pane shows the branch its folder is on.** The dashboard row leads its second line with
  the branch, the pane header shows it after the workspace, and the Files header after the folder. A
  detached head reads `detached @abc1234`, and a long name keeps its end. The bridge reads it from
  two small files in the repo, with no git process and no lock, and never makes a snapshot wait for
  it. A pane outside a repo, a pane on zellij older than 0.44 and a crew member on an older version
  show none. ([e8901aeb](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/e8901aeb))
- **zellij panes know their folder.** On zellij 0.44 and later, Collie reads each pane's folder from
  zellij's own pane listing, which zellij takes live from the system. A zellij pane now gets the Files
  button and the Changes mark, shows its branch, and a launcher started beside it opens in that
  folder. An older zellij still reports none, and its panes stay as they were. ([ff713b34](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/ff713b34))
- **Settings shows whether secrets are masked.** Settings → System has a read-only Secret masking
  row that says On or Off, as the bridge reports it. The first time a pane shows masked text, a short
  line says the dots are on purpose and the value is to be read on the machine; the X retires it on
  that device for good. A reply that holds masked text gets a caution under the box, and Send still
  works. The switch stays `COLLIE_REDACT` on the bridge: the phone has none, so a paired or stolen
  phone cannot turn the mask off. An older bridge shows a dash. ([a96f732b](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/a96f732b))

### Changed

- **The connection strip floats under the header, and nothing moves for it.** The band that held
  the connection, auth and update strips painted above the header and pushed the whole page when a
  strip came or went. It is an overlay now, anchored to the header's bottom edge with a shadow: it
  covers the pane strip or the filter row while it shows, and the X uncovers it. The header owns the
  notch inset for good, the "as of" chip left it, and the brand column cannot be squeezed by the
  chips beside it. "Saved copy from …" left its own bar too: it is the first line of the transcript
  or the mirror, where "Start of the conversation" and "Load older" sit, and scrolls with the text. ([a1365ba8](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/a1365ba8))
- **The connection strip can be hidden, and the Collie mark shows the state after that.** The red
  strip keeps one button, Retry, and gets an X. Hidden, it stays hidden for the rest of that outage
  and comes back on the next one; recovery after a hide shows no green flash. While the connection is
  lost, the Collie mark in the header carries a small badge with the same icon as the strip, so the
  state stays visible with the strip gone. ([cad7da56](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/cad7da56))
- **The offline draft note floats above the belt and can be dismissed.** "The draft stays on this
  phone" used to open under the input field and push the field up. It now shows in the same floating
  card as the terminal-draft notice, one notice at a time, with an X, and moves nothing. It shows
  only on the first keystroke while offline that leaves text in the field, not on going offline. ([cad7da56](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/cad7da56))
- **The file screen in Changes: icons, a path row, and a clearer end of the list.** The Diff, Source
  and Preview switcher shows icons, each with its word as the title and the accessible name. A thin
  mono row under the name shows the path from the repo root, only when the name row has to cut the
  path short, and folds the middle folders to an ellipsis when the row is too narrow, the file name
  last to go. Previous and Next lose their border and go muted when there is nothing to step to. ([cad7da56](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/cad7da56))
- **Switching a changed file between Changes and Code shows the held diff at once.** The diff of the
  open file stays read while its source shows, and the poll keeps it fresh, so the way back no
  longer reloads it. The refresh button still reads it again. ([918576dd](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/918576dd))
- **Pairing is always on, and every request needs the token, reads included.** A bridge with no
  paired device answers `403 device not paired` to every `/api/*` route except `/api/health` and
  `/api/pair`, so run `collie pair` on the host first; `collie doctor` and the installers now say so.
  Reads (the herd, panes, history, chat, changes, files, images and fonts) need a valid pairing
  token like writes did; the crew path between bridges keeps its own trust. The gate sits in front of
  the router with a two-entry allowlist, and a corrupt pairing file answers 503, never "not paired". The worktree list route
  had no gate at all and now has one. This is a break for unpaired browsers on the tailnet and for
  scripted setups (ADR 0086). Unknown `/api/*` paths answer 403 then 404 instead of the app shell.
  Desktop browsers and scripts on the tailnet must pair once: run `collie pair` (or
  `collie pair --expires 30d` for a script), and the script claims the code with a label such as
  `script`; the token comes back once, in the pair answer. A CLI on the host (`doctor`, `history`,
  the crew update sweep) reads its own bridge with a local credential the bridge writes to the state
  directory, so nothing changes there. The bridge takes it from loopback only and never on a request
  that carries a proxy's header such as `X-Forwarded-For`; a crew member bound to its tailnet
  address also takes it from its own addresses. `scripts/capture-fixture.sh` and `scripts/crew-mux-probe.ts` send `COLLIE_TOKEN`
  or that local credential. The startup warning for an empty `COLLIE_TRUSTED_USER` no longer
  claims full write access. Two claims racing on one pairing code now enrol one device, and wrong
  guesses that race each count toward the five tries. ([e52c8851](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/e52c8851))
- **Rolling back below 1.18.0 ignores token expiries.** An older bridge does not know the
  `expiresAt` field, so an expired device works again until the bridge is updated; revoke it instead
  if that matters. ([52df1b5e](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/52df1b5e))
- **A file in Files gets the screen.** On a phone the All files | Changes control and the two-row
  file bar held the top 227 px of 844 before the first line of the file, and stayed pinned while
  you read. While a file is open the control leaves, and the file's name, size and Source | Preview
  control share one 44 px row, so the file starts 122 px higher. ([be6d473c](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/be6d473c))
- **Files repeats its Back at the foot of a phone.** The arrow in the header is out of a thumb's reach
  on a large phone, so on a phone every level of the Files screen (the list, a diff, the commit, a
  folder, a file, a picture) ends in a bar with a Back button on your thumb's side, the right end or,
  with the left-hand layout, the left. It does what the arrow does and carries the same name. On a
  diff it sits in the Previous / Next bar. It hides while the keyboard is open, and a wider screen
  keeps the arrow alone. ([93124ff9](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/93124ff9))
- **The dashboard's top is one control bar.** Under the header, one line of state words ("3 needs you,
  2 unseen, 7 working, 2 idle") with the needs-you switch at its right end, then one row with a
  Workspace select and a Pane order select. The chip strip, the counts line and the three glyph
  toggles are gone. The words stay one line at 360, 390 and 412px: when the line is too wide the
  lowest-priority counts drop their word and keep a dot and a number, and past that whole counts
  leave the row, still named for a screen reader. A workspace's option says its state in words, a
  workspace or machine you hid is brought back from the list, and a long press no longer hides a
  workspace. ([d7a323c3](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d7a323c3))

### Fixed

- **Russian has its own letters in the interface face.** Aldrich draws no Cyrillic, so Russian fell back
  to the system font, about 13% too large. A 5 KB Cyrillic companion (Play, SIL OFL 1.1) now loads
  only once Cyrillic text is on screen, so English devices never fetch it, and it matches Aldrich's
  letter size and line height. Under Space Grotesk, Russian no longer renders about 7.5% too large. ([636396c6](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/636396c6))
- **Herdr 0.9.3 hid every repository from Collie.** The workspace row no longer carries the repo, so
  the New worktree tab listed nothing and the Files view lost the workspace folder. The bridge now
  asks Herdr's worktree list once per workspace and caches it (ADR 0032 addendum). ([52a89b69](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/52a89b69))
- **Six older translations had lost a placeholder.** "Show in {mux}" had become "Show in the
  terminal" in German, Spanish, Japanese, Korean and both Chinese files, and the Korean status label
  kept an em dash. A parity test now checks every translation against English for keys,
  placeholders and em dashes. ([e628a92e](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/e628a92e))
- **A pane opened while offline no longer reads as gone.** A pane address carries no dashboard
  scope, so with the bridge away the herd for that address was empty and the pane looked closed:
  "(agent gone)", "Pane is gone". "Gone" now needs a live answer. Offline, the pane's row comes
  from any herd the phone kept for that machine, and a pane with no saved text says "No saved copy
  of this pane on this phone." with Send off. ([297fb93f](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/297fb93f))
- **A link right under the tab row takes the tap.** The tab and pane pills' tap areas reached 14 to
  18px below their rows, over the first line of the content, so a path link there mostly opened a
  tab instead. Each pill's tap area now ends at its own row: 30px tall for tabs, 26px for panes. ([25e7988b](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/25e7988b))
- **A Chat no longer stays blank when you come back to it early.** Leaving a pane for Files,
  History or Changes and returning before its first refresh could show an empty Chat until the
  session changed: the phone asked "anything new?" for a window it no longer held. It now asks only
  when it says which window it holds. ([d2a35456](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d2a35456))
- **Back in Files goes where you came from.** A file opened from a path a pane printed, from a diff's
  Preview or from a link in a Markdown file now backs out to that pane, diff or file with the arrow,
  the same screen the edge swipe lands on. It used to walk up the folders one at a time. A breadcrumb
  to a folder above you pops back to it instead of stacking a second copy. Files opened from a pane
  that has moved into a subfolder now starts in that folder, with the root one crumb away (ADR 0067). ([918576dd](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/918576dd))
- **Typed characters never reach the audit log.** Type mode sends one key per character, and the
  audit trail listed `keys` as a parameter, so a password typed on the phone landed in `audit.log`
  character by character, even with `COLLIE_AUDIT_CONTENT=none`. Typed characters, spaces and tabs
  are now a body: redacted under `none`, a count of `•` marks under the default preview. Named keys
  such as Enter and Ctrl+C stay readable. Audit files written before 1.18.0 may still hold typed
  characters; rotate or delete them. ([2871d0fd](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/2871d0fd))
- **Chat dropped queued messages while a background task finished.** Claude Code keeps one queue for
  your messages and its own notifications, and takes the front one off. Collie counted only your
  messages, so each finished task or subagent pushed your oldest waiting message off its list while
  Claude Code still showed it queued. Two queued messages could show as one, or none. The queue now
  keeps a place for every entry, matches a notification by its kind and body when Claude Code rewrites
  it on the way out, and clears a message once the transcript shows it delivered, so a sent message
  never stays "Waiting to send". Claude Code's own plain-text notices no longer show as yours. ([3281c35b](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/3281c35b))
- **The connection strip no longer hides the first line under it.** The strip is drawn over the top of
  the screen, and on a pane with one tab it covered the "Saved copy from" line, which sits at the top
  of the thread, until you tapped the X. The strip now tells the scrolling list how far it reaches
  into it, and the list starts below it. Settings, Crew, Machines, Updates and History keep their
  first row clear the same way. ([25e7988b](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/25e7988b))
- **A photo send no longer flashes the draft card while it is checked.** Sending a photo types its
  path into the terminal's input line, and the "Draft in terminal" card read that as a draft of yours
  until the send was verified. The card now waits while a send is in flight, and a draft that is still
  there afterwards shows again. Thanks @AndiWandHerd (#370). ([ca450d62](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/ca450d62))
- **A slash command sends in omp while its command palette is open.** On omp 18.8's pi-shaped input
  box, typing a slash command opens a palette below the box and hides the status row, and Collie no
  longer found the box, so the command stayed typed and never sent. The palette now counts as the
  box's footer, and the command is read back and then submitted. Thanks @thelinuxlich (#373). ([9acc1502](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/9acc1502))
- **A poll that got no answer is retried within a second.** After a poll timed out or never reached
  the bridge, the next one waited the full gap of four to six seconds, so a link that came back at
  once still looked down. Such a poll is now retried after 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 seconds, never slower than
  the normal gap, and the first answer ends the run. An error from the bridge or a refusal keeps the
  normal gap. Thanks @kekefigure (#375). ([2ca2d776](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/2ca2d776))
- **Coming back to the app no longer flashes the connection bar red.** Over a Tailscale relay, the
  first poll after you return often gets no answer while the link wakes up, and the phone took that
  one poll as a lost bridge. Right after a return, one poll with no answer now counts as a first
  strike: the phone asks again half a second later, and shows the red bar and the saved copy only if
  that poll gets no answer too. At any other time the first poll with no answer still shows them at
  once. ([e53186c0](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/e53186c0))
- **An Antigravity pane with a tall status line is no longer read as an unread dialog.** A custom
  `statusLine` that prints four or more rows pushed the input box's bottom rule out of the part of
  the screen Collie searched, so an idle pane read as not ready and the phone drew the unread-dialog
  card over it. Collie now looks up to eight status rows under the box, as it does for Claude Code.
  Thanks @alvinycheung (#374). ([5ff8a920](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/5ff8a920))
- **A one-option question dialog in Antigravity is no longer read as an idle input box.** With the wider
  status search, the rule under the "Question" label of a dialog with one option and a write-in fell
  inside it, so the phone could show the composer as ready and type into the open dialog. A footer
  hint, "esc to cancel" or a numbered menu under a rule now means the rule belongs to a dialog, and
  no input box is found there. ([ec3e5efc](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/ec3e5efc))

## [1.17.2] - 2026-10-06

### Fixed

- **The question shows once on a prompt card.** In the Terminal view, a Codex, Grok, opencode, omp or Antigravity card whose rows the card already shows no longer prints the question twice, above the card and on it. A fade now shows at the bottom of the card's command or diff while more of it continues below.
- **The slash-command list is read again on Claude Code 2.1.291.** That version marks the selected command with a pointer and indents the list differently, so the list stayed on the raw terminal view, and with a long list open the phone could not send at all. Collie now reads both layouts, and the composer stays sendable while the list is open.
- **The effort card shows only real levels on Claude Code 2.1.291.** That build replaced the `ultracode` level with a toggle beside the `/effort` slider, and the card listed the words of its `Tab to toggle` hint as three more levels. The `/tasks`, `/resume` and rewind panels on Claude Code 2.1.291 are now checked against captures of that build, and read as before.
- **A multi-line draft no longer reads as a plan dialog.** On Claude Code 2.1.291 a multi-line draft printed a `ctrl+g` hint that Collie read as a plan dialog, so the phone showed the unread-dialog card and a send stalled. The plan family is now claimed only when the plan dialog's own words are on screen. A draft that quotes a plan dialog is never read as one. The plan dialog at 40 columns, whose question, hint and plan path wrap onto extra rows, now lifts with the same buttons as at 82 columns.

## [1.17.1] - 2026-10-06

### Fixed

- **Permission cards show what the agent asks for.** The card now shows the dialog's header, the command or diff, any warning, and the question above the buttons. A permission raised by a subagent used to show only Yes and No in the Chat view, because the card left the rest in the terminal rows above it, which are off screen. A long command or diff scrolls inside the card, so the buttons stay in reach. Every other question card shows its question as text too.

## [1.17.0] - 2026-10-06

### Added

- **The dashboard can order by Activity or Cache.** On the Dashboard tab, a clock and an hourglass beside the status line order the dashboard by the pane where something last happened, or by the cache that goes cold first. Either one folds the workspace groups into one list, with pinned panes first and each row naming its workspace. It is the same per-device setting as the switcher and Settings → Appearance, Place stays the default, and the order is read once and held, so a poll never moves a row. Tapping the selected choice, or coming back to the page, reads it again.
- **The Quick dock offers "drastically simplify".** It is the last phrase of the common group for every agent pane, and a long phrase now wraps inside its button instead of running past it. A `quick-replies.toml` that already addresses a pane replaces the shipped list, so add the phrase to your own file to keep it there.
- **Files shows the files of the workspace's folder with the changes marked, and Markdown, JSON and HTML files open as a Preview.** The screen that was Changes is now called Files and opens on the folder it reads, one folder at a time. A changed file shows its status letter and an icon in the same colour, a new untracked file counts as changed, a folder shows a dot and how many changed files are inside it, and a deleted file stays in its folder, struck through, with a D. An **All files | Changes** control under the header chooses the body: Changes carries the number of changed files in a small badge and shows the list of changes as before, headed by the count of changed files and its `+added −removed` totals; the choice stays on the device, and it is All files at first. The list's List and Tree choice is now one Tree button, so the header keeps room for the workspace's name. A changed file opens on its Diff, with Source and Preview one tap away, and a new file shows as all added. A file opens as numbered, coloured source. A Markdown file previews as text, a JSON file as a tree that folds, and an HTML file in a sandboxed frame that runs no scripts and loads nothing remote. Links in a Markdown file work: a relative link opens that file or folder, a `#heading` link scrolls to the heading, a web link opens in a new tab, and a link that leaves the folder reads as plain text. A changed file of those types has a Preview button in its diff header, which opens the same file screen on Preview. Back goes up one level, from a file to its folder and from a folder to the one above. A folder or a file is read when it opens or on refresh, never on a timer, and an older crew member answers "Update this machine to browse files". When the folder cannot be shown, for an unpaired device or a workspace in the home folder, Files offers **Show changes**. On the bridge, `GET /api/pane/:id/files` and `GET /api/workspace/:id/files` list one folder (`?dir=`) or read one text file (`?path=`) under the same folder the Changes view reads, and nowhere else. A path that leads out of it, also through a symlink, a `.git` folder, Collie's own state and config folders, and any file named like a Collie state secret (`paired-devices.json`, `crew-trust.json` and the rest) are refused with one answer. It needs an authorised device, like a write, caps a folder at 2000 entries and a file at 1 MiB, and works on a crew member running 1.17.0 or later (ADR 0083). The tree hides what git ignores, such as `node_modules` and build output, with a quiet "{count} ignored hidden" line and a Show action, which turns into "{count} ignored shown" and a Hide action once they are shown (the Filter row has the same choice, as an "Ignored hidden" or "Ignored shown" toggle); a Filter button in the header holds the name field, and an ignored file still opens. The device check is on only when a device is paired or `COLLIE_DEVICE_HEADER` is set. Until then, every device that can read panes can browse and read files under that folder, `.env` files included. Credential files under it are readable too: a workspace opened in `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, `~/.config/gh` or `~/.ssh` shows what is there, and a hard link to a file outside the folder is not caught.
- **Machines show every machine's load and disks for a day and hold its alert rules.** Each Collie reads its own CPU, memory, load and network on the tick it already runs, about every 15 to 25 seconds, and the lead every 5 seconds while a phone has its machines open, so every minute has a reading and a sample costs well under a millisecond. Once a minute it also reads how full the disks that hold the home folder, the root (the system drive on Windows) and Collie's state folder are, with numbers that match `df`, in the background so a hung network mount never holds it up; a read-only system image such as the Fedora Atomic root, and any filesystem under 1 GiB, is left out. A crew member sends its last reading with the answer the lead already asks for, and the lead keeps one point per minute for 24 hours. A Collie with no crew keeps the same day for its own machine. Settings, Machines lists each machine's CPU, memory, fullest disk, network and load now, with the lead first, and a small chart of CPU and memory over the last 30 minutes. The dashboard's Crew tab shows the same cards, read every 15 seconds while it is on screen, and back from a machine returns to it. A machine's page has two views. Status shows the numbers, a bar for each disk, and charts of CPU, memory, the fullest disk and network over the last hour or the last 24 hours, with a gap wherever minutes are missing. Alerts (`?tab=alerts`) sets a CPU, memory or disk alert: a threshold of 80, 90 or 95 percent held for 5 to 60 minutes, and the lead sends one push when a value stays above the line. A firing alert is named in words on its card, and that line opens the Alerts view, whose switch shows a dot while a rule fires; switching views adds no step, so Back leaves the machine. A machine that is not answering shows the age of its last reading, one that answers but has sent no new reading for two minutes shows its numbers greyed with that age, and a member on an older Collie says it needs an update. A machine's page reads the day once and then only the newest minutes, once a minute, and nothing Machines-related is read for a page or tab that is not on screen. The lead keeps a day of one machine in about 68 KB of memory and writes it at most every five minutes, only when it changed. Settings, Alerts, "Machine load stays high" turns every machine rule off at once, and it is on by default, and a machine alert opens the machine's Status view on the phone. An alert reports sustained high load only, not a machine that goes offline. Network on Linux counts the physical interfaces only, so traffic through a bridge, a container or a tunnel is counted once. The pages need the lead of a crew or a collie on its own. A deputy that takes over starts with no history and no rules, and a collie on its own that becomes a lead drops the history it kept for itself. Nothing leaves the crew. See `docs/crew.md`, *Machines*.
- **Collie can drive the Tern multiplexer.** Set `COLLIE_MUX=tern` to watch and answer agents in Tern (`so.stencil.tern`, probed on 0.4.5) from the phone. A Tern session is a space, a tab is a tab and a block is a pane. Collie reads the screen with its colours and its scrollback, types text and keys, moves the focus, and creates, renames and closes tabs. Agents are found through the beacon hooks. Tern is experimental and `collie start` does not detect it, so name it. Details: `docs/multiplexers.md`. Thanks @Codder13 (#356)

### Changed

- **The Changes list's List and Tree choice is one Tree button.** It sits in the header beside Filter, pressed while the list draws as a folder tree, and the list shows only when the Changes segment under the header is on. One square less leaves the workspace's name readable on a 375 px phone.
- **The dashboard's tabs are Crew, Dashboard and Files.** The first tab is now called Dashboard. With a crew the footer reads Crew, Dashboard, Files, so the default sits in the middle, and a Collie on its own reads Dashboard, Files. The third tab, which was Changes, is Files now, with the tree glyph, and still lists each workspace's changes; the stored tab choice is unchanged, and the icon-only button on the pane's Chat belt that opens the same screen is named Files. Focus is no longer a tab: it is the circle-dot switch in the summary line, beside the order toggle, and it filters the Dashboard list the way Focus did. A device that had Focus selected opens the Dashboard with the switch on. Crew is a new tab that appears left of Dashboard only while you run a crew, and a device that stored it keeps the choice if the crew goes away. The red count of blocked panes now sits on the Dashboard tab.
- **Chat is the default view of an agent pane.** An agent pane opens as the agent's own conversation on every device, and the Chat switch under Settings → Experiments is gone. A new agent pane shows Chat from its first frame, even before Codex reports its session or pi writes its log, with one quiet line that says how to begin. It falls back to the terminal only when something happens that Chat cannot show: the agent asks a question, or its first turn ends with nothing to read. As a last resort it also falls back when a pane works for a minute with nothing to read and sends no event at all. The bridge polls faster for a few beats after you type or start an agent, so the conversation shows up without waiting for the next idle poll. The pane's ⋮ menu has **Terminal view** one tap away, and a device that already chose the terminal keeps it. Hermes can still lose a turn from its own log, and the docs under "Chat view" say so. This brings forward the flip that 1.15.0 planned for 2.0.
- **The pane name opens Pane settings, and the workspace line opens the space.** The header's single tap target is now two, one per line, each as wide as the block. Pane settings gains a **Rename** row that opens the same rename view as the ⋮ menu.
- **The dashboard follows an Activity or Cache order you already chose.** A device that picked Activity or Cache order in the pane switcher before 1.17.0 now sees the dashboard in that order too. Choose Place in Settings → Appearance to get the workspace groups back.

### Fixed

- **The dashboard summary is one row: words while there is room, else dots and numbers.** With one or two states the first reads "● 2 needs you"; with three or more every state is a dot and a number, so all five fit a phone beside the sort controls. It never wraps or grows taller, fades at its right edge for huge numbers, and the button still names every count in words.
- **An opencode draft and dialog read correctly with a sidebar open beside the pane.** A sidebar row that shares a row with the composer or a dialog is now skipped, so the Draft card shows what you typed, the reply guard can verify the send, and a question card is not lost behind the sidebar's box glyphs. Thanks @AndiWandHerd (#352). ([fedbe6dc](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/fedbe6dc))
- **A tabbed opencode question lifts with a sidebar row under the free-text row.** With the Models sidebar open, a sidebar row under "Type your own answer" made Collie read the input as open, so a multi-select question or one with several tabs showed no card. That row is now ignored while the pointer is on a real option, and committed text that shares its row with the sidebar still reads as committed. An open input still shows no card. Thanks @AndiWandHerd (#347).
- **An iOS home-screen launch fills the screen to the bottom edge.** Every screen now takes its height from one `--app-h` token, which reads the full height in a home-screen launch on iOS, so the tab bar and composer no longer float over a dead band above the home indicator. Thanks @broven (#355). ([3007f8e2](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/3007f8e2))
- **On macOS, `collie start` and `collie restart` start the launchd job and check that it runs.** Before, they printed "bridge started" as soon as launchd loaded the job, even when no process came up, and `collie status` then said "loaded, not running" with an empty log. Collie now runs `launchctl kickstart` on the job after it loads it, reads the job back for up to two seconds, and prints "bridge started" only when launchd reports a pid. If none shows, it warns that the job is loaded but not running and prints `launchctl kickstart gui/<uid>/herdr.collie` and the log path. The exit code stays 0, as on systemd, and the status banner shows the state. This has not been tried on macOS 26 yet. Thanks @babhishek21 (#213). Reported by @PhillipChaffee (#213).
- **The agent-start animation and the switch to Chat are one sequence.** When a shell turned into an agent, the animation ran on its own clock while the pane swapped from the terminal to Chat whenever the first answer arrived, so the swap showed beside it. The swap now happens under the animation, once it covers the pane, and the animation lifts when its own short dwell ends. It waits for no session and no first answer, and it has no cap, because a new agent pane draws Chat at once. A tap on it still ends it at once.
- **The global cache warning switch now stays on.** Settings, Alerts, "Cache about to go cold" showed the switch move and then fall back, because the bridge dropped that key from the request and kept the old value. Panes watched one by one were not affected.
- **tmux listings read the same with no UTF-8 locale.** Collie now starts every tmux command as a UTF-8 client with `-u`. Before, a bridge started with no UTF-8 locale, in a minimal container or a systemd unit, got `_` where tmux prints its field separator, so every listing parsed to zero rows and the phone showed the multiplexer as disconnected. It also keeps a non-ASCII session or window name intact. Thanks @WynandVStaden (#360). Reported by @cyxou (#358).
- **The red connection bar no longer blames Herdr for an unreachable crew member.** Viewing a member, the bar asked the lead whether it was up, and when the lead answered it said "Herdr is down on the host" even though the fault was the member. Now that sentence shows only for a solo install or the lead, and a member view says "{name} is unreachable" or that it runs an incompatible Collie when the lead's roster says so, and "Can't reach Collie" otherwise. Thanks @toRolex (#361). Reported by @cyxou (#357).
- **A Claude mode badge no longer shows as the session name.** On an unnamed session, Claude draws a mode badge such as `ultracode` in the rule above the `❯` prompt, where a `/rename` name sits, and Collie took it for the name and kept it. The bridge now reads that rule with its colours, takes the words as a name only when they share the rule's colour or sit on a chip of it, and drops a cached name when the input box shows none. A multiplexer that hands over no colour still reads the badge as a name. Thanks @GGGODLIN (#363).


## [1.16.2] - 2026-10-04

### Fixed

- **The pane row scrolls sideways on an iPhone.** With more panes in a tab than fit the screen, the row did not move under a thumb on iOS Safari, so the panes past the edge could not be reached from it. The tab row was not affected. Thanks @enieuwy (#350). ([cbc94647](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/cbc94647))
- **An overlay row under the free-text row no longer hides the opencode question card.** When opencode drew a foreign row under the closed "Type your own answer" row, Collie read it as an open input and showed no card. The row is now ignored unless the pointer is on the free-text row. Thanks @AndiWandHerd (#348). ([418e978f](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/418e978f))
- **A long reply or voice note reaches Claude whole.** A reply over 800 characters now goes to a Claude pane as one bracketed paste. Before, Claude kept only its last 1 KB or so and Collie submitted that. Text inside the reply cannot end the paste early, and an image marker in the box is accepted only for a picture Collie attached. Thanks @wwilson1017 (#349). ([b9efb5c9](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/b9efb5c9))
- **Claude Code's "Switch model?" question gets its two buttons.** After the model picker, Claude Code 2.1.286 and later asks "Switch model?" when the conversation is cached. Collie could not read that screen and offered only Esc, which cancels the switch. The card now shows "Yes, switch" and "No, go back". A tap moves the pointer, checks it, then sends Enter, and never a digit. ([3e7d1f78](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/3e7d1f78))
- **A card button works on the first tap after an arrow tap.** After "Move up" or "Move down" on a card, the card could keep the old highlight for up to six seconds, and the next button answered "The screen changed". Each key Collie sends now starts the fast refresh, and the card waits for the new picture, for 1.2 seconds at most, before it takes the next tap. ([2a64ebad](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/2a64ebad))

## [1.16.1] - 2026-10-03

### Changed

- **Release pages and the changelog no longer repeat the upgrade path from 0.x.** The steps stay in `docs/upgrading.md` under "Upgrading from 0.x to 1.0". ([8b1f4faf](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/8b1f4faf))
- **The Windows note on a release page names the installer and the setup guide.** It said "There is no installer yet", which has been false since `install.ps1`. It now gives the `irm https://colliepwa.dev/install.ps1 | iex` command and links `docs/windows.md`, and the README inside the zip says the same. ([8b1f4faf](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/8b1f4faf))

### Fixed

- **On Windows (experimental): `collie doctor` and `collie crew status` no longer suggest `collie crew invite`.** With no crew, both ended on "`collie crew invite` here makes it a lead; `collie join …` makes it a peer", and both verbs refuse on Windows. They now say "A Windows machine cannot join or lead a crew in this release." Linux and macOS print what they printed before. ([c9322daa](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/c9322daa))
- **On Windows (experimental): `collie doctor` no longer tells you to run `collie serve`.** Collie publishes no front door on Windows, so the `front-door` remedies sent you to a command that does nothing useful there. They now give the Tailscale command to run by hand, `tailscale serve --bg --set-path=/ <port>`, with a reminder to pair a device right away, and point to `docs/windows.md`. A mapping you made by hand that points at Collie now passes the `front-door` check instead of warning. Linux and macOS print what they printed before. ([ebc5f304](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/ebc5f304))
- **On Windows (experimental): `collie doctor` passes a front door published over HTTP on a Headscale tailnet.** Headscale issues no HTTPS certificates, so the Windows guide publishes with `tailscale serve --bg --http=80 --set-path=/ <port>`. The `front-door` check kept the warning "this tailnet has no HTTPS certificates" after that. It now looks for a mapping made by hand that points at Collie, on port 80 too, before it asks about certificates. Linux and macOS print what they printed before. ([1418ba02](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/1418ba02))
- **Windows commands find PowerShell again when PowerShell 7 is installed.** The tool lookup now skips a directory that carries the tool's name. On Windows 11 with PowerShell 7, `System32\PowerShell` is a directory, and it came before the real `powershell.exe` on PATH. It was picked as the program, so `collie status`, `doctor`, `start`, `restart`, `stop`, `uninstall` and the update check all failed. Thanks @ronanflannery (#344). ([a86d8b91](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/a86d8b91))
- **The Finished alert no longer misses a turn that ends as idle.** Herdr 0.9 can report a finished turn as idle instead of done, and tmux and zellij always do, so the push did not fire there. A working agent that goes idle now counts as finished, on this machine and for crew peers. Answering a prompt does not count. An agent you interrupt also goes idle and pushes too. Finished is off by default, in Settings → Alerts. Thanks @homieyangg (#345). ([a01c22e6](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/a01c22e6))
- **OMP panes with the `claude` or `borderless` composer shape accept a send.** Collie found no input box in these two shapes, so every send asked "Type anyway?". Both are now recognised, and a draft left in the terminal reads back. Captured on OMP 18.4.10. Thanks @nhl4000 (#343). ([1897d3cc](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/1897d3cc))

## [1.16.0] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- **Oh My Pi's `/resume` picker is a list of sessions on the phone.** Tap a session and Collie
  moves the pointer to it and presses Enter, in the boxed picker of omp 18.4 and the unboxed one
  before it. On a very large pane the picker stays terminal text with an Escape button. Every other
  Oh My Pi dialog that names its way out, such as `/model`, `/settings`, an Ask question or a tool
  approval, now shows a button for that key. `/tree` names none, so it keeps no button. ([d83f3281](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d83f3281))
- **`collie doctor` checks Oh My Pi's Herdr hook.** An `omp` pane that reported no session had no
  line of its own in `agent-sessions`, so its missing Chat and History went unexplained. The doctor
  now names the pane and the `integration-omp` line, which says to run
  `herdr integration install omp` and restart the agent. ([13eaf692](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/13eaf692))
- **Oh My Pi's Ask questions with one answer are buttons on the phone.** Tap an answer and Collie
  moves the pointer to it and presses Enter, so the agent gets the answer at once. `Other (type your
  own)` opens omp's answer box, and the phone's composer types into it. A question where you pick
  several answers, several questions in one call, options with descriptions, or a long list still
  show the terminal text with an Escape button. ([3c5dbab6](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/3c5dbab6))
- **Oh My Pi's `bash` and `write` approvals are buttons on the phone.** The card names the tool and
  shows the whole command, or the path and all of the file's content, on the Approve button. Approve,
  Deny and Cancel each take one tap, and Deny can never land on Approve, even if the pointer moves at
  the desk. Approvals for other tools, a third choice, a countdown, text omp itself cut short, a file
  of more than thirty rows, hidden or direction-changing characters, or a screen that is not omp
  18.4.10 or 18.1.17 still show the terminal text with an Escape button, which denies. ([0f50426b](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/0f50426b))
- **`collie start`, `stop`, `restart`, `status` and `uninstall` supervise the bridge on Windows through Task Scheduler.** (experimental) `start` registers the task `herdr.collie` at your logon with a limited token and runs a launcher Collie owns, which relaunches a bridge that exits with an error. `status` names the task and its state, `restart` restarts the bridge alone, and an install of the community script is taken over under the same task name. The first supervisor was written by @JJLiebig in contrib/windows, and the restart path by @mqmalagris (PR 309). ([17d29445](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/17d29445))
- **`collie status` and `collie doctor` say whose Task Scheduler task runs on Windows.** Status names Collie's launcher or the old script's loop, `doctor` gains a `windows-task` line, and a task that still points at the deleted script is reported as `Task herdr.collie still runs the old script. Run: collie restart`. `start` refuses a task that runs another install and prints `Registered Task Scheduler job herdr.collie (starts at logon)`. ([8cd2487d](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/8cd2487d))
- **Oh My Pi's model picker is a list of models on the phone.** With omp 18.4.10, `/switch` and Alt+P
  open omp's session-only model picker. The card lists the rows the picker shows right now, not the
  whole catalog. Tap a model and Collie moves the pointer to it and presses Enter, which switches this
  session's model and leaves your role models and config as they are. The current model is named on
  the card but cannot be tapped. To reach a model that is not listed, type a search through Keys or
  Type mode, and the card updates after about a second. A row omp cut short and a model the
  conversation no longer fits (picking it compacts first) are left out. The `@` quick roles, the
  task-model picker, narrow panes and the Nerd Font symbols stay terminal text with an Escape button. ([ddcb2759](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/ddcb2759))
- **Voice input can run a transcription command already on your machine.** The new `local-cli` provider runs a command such as `whisper-cli` or `muesli-cli` once per recording, with the recording's path as its last argument, and takes the transcript from its stdout. Set it up with `collie stt setup --provider local-cli --command <path> --args <list>`, and check it with `collie stt test`. Collie runs it without a shell, as the bridge's user, and kills it after 60 seconds. The phone never sees its command line or its error output. Thanks @SubodhDahal (#227). ([64c65416](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/64c65416))
- **The `local-cli` provider cleans up after the command it runs.** On Linux and macOS the command starts in its own process group, and Collie kills the whole group with SIGKILL at the 60-second limit, at the 256 KiB stdout cap, and after a clean exit, so a process the command started cannot outlive it. At most two dictations run the command at once, and a third gets the busy answer without starting anything. `collie stt setup` and `collie stt status` refuse a command that is not a regular, executable file and say why. Temp folders left by a bridge that was killed are removed at the next start once they are an hour old (#227). ([1622bbf4](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/1622bbf4))
- **Collie can check the Cloudflare Access token itself.** Set `COLLIE_ACCESS_TEAM` and
  `COLLIE_ACCESS_AUD`, and every request through the tunnel must carry a `Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion`
  that Cloudflare signed for this application. A deleted Access app, a bypass rule or a policy that
  has not propagated yet then shows the panes to nobody. Half a setting, or keys Collie could not
  fetch, refuse every tunnel request. Unset, nothing changes. Thanks @xbach (#341). ([072e6abc](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/072e6abc))
- **With the Access gate on, only a process on the machine itself skips the token.** A request
  that carries a forwarding header (`X-Forwarded-For`, `Forwarded`, `X-Real-Ip` and the like) needs
  the token too, so `tailscale serve` beside the tunnel stops serving browsers. `COLLIE_ACCESS_TEAM`
  must name a `<team>.cloudflareaccess.com` team, so the key fetch cannot be pointed at another host.
  The fetch gives up after 5 seconds, reads at most 64 KiB and follows no redirect. A bad setting or a
  failed first fetch prints one line in the bridge log that names the cause.
  The app's manifest is fetched with the Access cookie, so the phone can install it behind Access. ([5addcf57](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/5addcf57))
- **Muse panes have History and Chat.** Collie reads Muse's own `session.jsonl` log, finds the newest
  session whose workspace is the pane's folder, and needs no Herdr hook, so a Muse pane no longer
  answers "no transcript". `collie doctor` reports the hook line as green for that reason.
  Thanks @jpcarranza94 (#333). ([49af69b6](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/49af69b6))
- **Each release now tries to build an experimental Windows zip (unsigned `collie.exe`).** `install.ps1` installs it, and `docs/windows.md` says how. Linux and macOS releases are unchanged. If the Windows build fails, the release still ships without it until one release has carried the zip, or until 2026-11-15. After that, and whenever GitHub's list of releases does not answer, a failed Windows build stops the release. ([c1da6cf0](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/c1da6cf0))
- **`install.ps1` installs Collie on Windows without a toolchain.** (experimental; it is not on colliepwa.dev yet, so download it from the repository and run it as a file, as `docs/windows.md` shows) `scripts/install.ps1` needs no Bun, Git or bash, and works in Windows PowerShell 5.1. It downloads a release's Windows zip, checks its sha256 and stops on a mismatch or a missing `.sha256`, lays it into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\collie\versions\<version>`, points the `current` junction at it, and adds `current\bin` to your user PATH. It never asks for admin and never starts Collie: it runs the new `collie.exe version` once to check that Windows lets it run, then prints the next steps. A second run changes nothing and points at `collie update`. `COLLIE_DIR`, `COLLIE_UPDATE_REPO` and `COLLIE_TAG` steer it, as they steer `install.sh`. ([57ce888e](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/57ce888e))
- **`collie uninstall` on a Windows binary install prints how to remove the rest.** (experimental) It keeps the install folder and the user PATH entry, as every install keeps its files, and now ends with the two PowerShell lines that remove them: `rmdir /s` for the folder and a registry edit that drops only `current\bin` from your PATH. Linux and macOS print what they printed before. ([55e0f29e](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/55e0f29e))
- **Windows 11 x64 with Herdr is a supported host, and it is still experimental.** A release carries the Windows zip when its Windows build succeeds, and `install.ps1` installs it. Until the Windows build is a required part of the release, a release may ship without it. Then `install.ps1` and `collie update` say so and install nothing. Linux and macOS behave exactly as before. A Windows workflow tests every push, but phone access needs a front door you set up yourself and has not been tested on Windows. `docs/windows.md` says what is covered, what is not (tmux, zellij, Windows on ARM, a Windows machine in a crew) and that `collie.exe` is unsigned. Thanks @JJLiebig for the first Windows supervisor and @mqmalagris (#309) for the restart and update path. ([4186abdf](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/4186abdf))

### Changed

- **A tap on a dialog card can bind a larger screen region.** The bridge accepted at most 8 KiB of the
  screen a card drew when it checked a tap, which a full-screen picker on a pane wider than about 134
  columns exceeds. The limit is now 32 KiB. A phone newer than its bridge still gets the old refusal on
  such a pane and no key is sent, so update the lead and its crew together. ([13a30db8](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/13a30db8))
- **Groundwork for Windows support.** The code that picks path rules or a binary name now reads one host object. Nothing changes on Linux or macOS. ([e9644cf4](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/e9644cf4))
- **The community Windows script in `contrib/windows` is gone, and Collie runs the task itself.** Every verb of `collie-ctl.ps1` is a `collie` verb of the same name: `update`, `build`, `version`, `logs`, `url`, `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `status` and `uninstall`. `COLLIE_TASK_NAME` is gone (the task is always `herdr.collie`), and so is the script's crash-log rotation: the bridge log is `collie.log` in the plugin config folder (`%APPDATA%\herdr\plugins\config\herdr.collie\collie.log` by default), appended to and never rotated. One Collie per Windows machine is supported: `start` refuses a task that runs another install, and warns when a second instance registers its own. Run `collie restart` once after updating (and `collie build` before it if the script's own `update` pulled this version). Until then `collie status` and `collie doctor` say `Task herdr.collie still runs the old script. Run: collie restart`. ([9c7650ad](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/9c7650ad))
- **The Spaces section follows the workspace you isolate.** Tap a workspace chip on the dashboard and
  the Spaces list shows that space and the worktrees of its repo. Tap All and every space is back.
  Thanks @dantebarba (#338). ([7a9532cd](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/7a9532cd))
- **On Windows (experimental): `collie crew invite`, `crew join` and `crew add` refuse at once.** A Windows machine cannot join a crew or take in a member in this release. The three verbs, and the old `collie join`, say so in one sentence, exit with an error and change nothing. `crew status` and `crew leave` still work, so crew state copied from another machine can be read and dropped. ([e1e3a833](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/e1e3a833))
- **On Windows (experimental): the crew verbs that join, lead or change a crew refuse at once.** A Windows machine cannot join, lead or change a crew in this release. `collie crew invite`, `crew join` (and the old `collie join`), `crew add`, `crew deputy`, `crew approve-promote` and `collie promote` say so in one sentence that points at docs/windows.md, exit with an error and change nothing. `crew status` and `crew leave` still work, so crew state copied from another machine can be read and dropped. ([c03a408a](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/c03a408a))

### Fixed

- **Windows no longer prints a false `.env` mode warning, and `collie doctor` checks Herdr's version there.** NTFS has no mode bits, so the line saying `.env` was tightened to 600 was untrue on every command. Collie now reads the file's access list instead (see the owner-only line below). `doctor` warns when Herdr on Windows is older than 0.9.3, the build Collie was checked with. ([9d6a695a](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/9d6a695a))
- **On Windows (experimental): the phone's Update button works.** It used to answer `412 no systemd user unit`, because the update's check looked for a systemd unit; it now asks Task Scheduler for the `herdr.collie` task. `collie doctor` no longer fails a Windows machine that has no Python, which also kept the button off. A source checkout is not updated on Windows: `collie update` and the button say so in one sentence and change nothing. ([a073e9fd](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/a073e9fd))
- **On Windows (experimental): `collie restart` says what it found and stops waiting after 30 seconds.** It says whether the bridge was running, gone, or whether the process list did not answer. It used to wait about 3 minutes for a bridge that did not come back, so a broken update took 221 seconds to roll back; now about 75. A launcher killed by hand comes back within 5 minutes. ([a073e9fd](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/a073e9fd))
- **On Windows (experimental): an old version folder that is still in use no longer fails the next update.** The update prints a note, and a later update removes the folder once nothing uses it. ([a073e9fd](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/a073e9fd))
- **On Windows (experimental): Collie keeps its secret files and folders private to your account, SYSTEM and Administrators.** It repairs loose permissions at start, only in its own folders. `collie doctor` checks this (`secrets-private`). The false `.env mode 666` warning is gone. Linux and macOS are unchanged. ([38bc979b](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/38bc979b))
- **A phone reply reaches omp's `ask` answer box.** Picking `Other (type your own)` or adding a note
  opens a box Collie did not recognise, so Send refused with "input box isn't on screen". Send now
  types, checks and submits there. A multi-line message is refused on that box, because a newline
  submits it. Thanks @enieuwy (#336). ([7d964012](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/7d964012))
- **A refused multi-line reply says when part of it was already typed.** On an input that submits on
  a newline, a long message sent in several parts could be refused after the first part landed, and
  the notice still said nothing was typed. It now says the earlier part is in the pane. Thanks
  @enieuwy (#336). ([ada4908c](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/ada4908c))
- **A tapped row is confirmed only after the pointer is seen on it.** A tap on a pointed list now sends the arrow keys first, reads the screen again, and sends Enter only when the pointer stands on the tapped row, bound to that very screen. A keystroke at the terminal in between, or a row that changed under the pointer, refuses the tap instead of confirming the wrong row. This covers every harness with a pointed list: Claude Code, Codex, Oh My Pi and opencode, whose permission buttons are a row and walk sideways. A resume list whose ages tick while the arrows go out still commits. A conformance guard now requires every such grammar to prove, on two real captures with the pointer on different rows, that a moved pointer is still the same dialog. ([ddcb2759](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/ddcb2759))
- **The model picker's Close button says when it clears a search instead.** With a search typed, Oh My Pi's Escape clears the search and keeps the picker open, so the button now reads "Clear search" and only reads "Close" when a tap closes the picker. ([ddcb2759](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/ddcb2759))
- **A tap on an opencode permission chip is bound to the highlighted chip.** The bridge now also checks the colours of the dialog it is about to answer, because opencode marks the chosen chip only by a background colour. A keystroke at the terminal that moved the highlight refuses the tap instead of confirming another chip. A refused tap also writes the reason to the browser console. ([cbd355a7](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/cbd355a7))
- **Sidebar edges and shared-row borders no longer leak into an opencode draft.** With a sidebar open over the composer, a row holding only the sidebar's `│` edge now reads as blank, and a panel's closing border on the same row as your words is cut off, so the Draft card shows what you typed and the reply guard verifies the send. A pasted box row such as `╭─ title ─╮`, a typed rule and a pasted tree keep their glyphs. Thanks @AndiWandHerd (#340, fixes #337). ([54bc0c1f](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/54bc0c1f))
- **The Escape button on a dialog Collie cannot read now needs a second tap.** The first tap only arms it, and it disarms by itself after four seconds. On an opencode question dialog the button reads "Tap again to dismiss", because Escape there ends the whole question turn. One stray tap no longer does that. Thanks @AndiWandHerd (#339). ([433722ba](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/433722ba))
- **On Windows (experimental): ending the task by hand no longer starts a second launcher.** Ending `herdr.collie` in Task Scheduler stops only its console window, so the launcher and the bridge kept running, and five minutes later the task started a second launcher. `collie restart` and `collie update` then acted on the second one while the first bridge kept the port, and an update could roll back for nothing. Each launcher now holds a named pipe for its life, and a second one exits when the first is a live Collie launcher of the same install. If anything else holds that pipe, the launcher writes one line in the log and runs anyway. ([a318c5d2](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/a318c5d2))
- **On Windows (experimental): `collie stop` no longer says "bridge stopped" when it could not look.** When PowerShell did not answer about the running processes, `stop` took that as "nothing is running", deleted its record of the launcher and the bridge, and printed `bridge stopped` over a bridge that was still running. It now keeps the record, says the process table could not be read, and fails, so you can run it again. ([60a33b2c](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/60a33b2c))
- **On Windows (experimental): Collie never changes the permissions of a `.env` or `config.toml` that is a link or a hard link.** The repair at start checked only the folder, so a second name for a file kept somewhere else would have carried Collie's new permissions to that file too. Such a file is now left as it is, its secrets are not loaded, and the warning gives the command to fix it yourself. ([12364f92](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/12364f92))
- **On Windows (experimental): updating again to a version you rolled back from no longer stops with an error.** The launcher keeps running from the version it started with, so that version's folder stays in use after a rollback, and the next update to the same version died when it tried to move the folder aside. If the folder is complete and holds the same build as the download, the update now uses it as it is and says so in a note. Otherwise the update stops, changes nothing, and says to run `collie stop` and `collie start` first. ([eab47316](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/eab47316))
- **On Windows (experimental): `install.ps1` with `COLLIE_TAG` over an install says to restart, not to start.** A pinned run that downloaded a version printed "Nothing is running yet" and `collie start`, though Collie may already run; it now prints `collie restart`, as the run that finds the version on disk already did. A `collie.exe version` check that hangs is now stopped together with every process below it, so it can no longer hold the new version's folder open. ([bfe89162](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/bfe89162))
- **On Windows (experimental): `collie restart` fails in plain words when Windows does not let it stop the bridge.** A bridge that runs as another account or as administrator cannot be stopped from a normal terminal, and the kill failed without a word. The old bridge then answered the wait for the new one, so the restart reported success while nothing restarted. It now looks again a second after the kill and, when the bridge is still there, says so and fails. ([3c914094](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/3c914094))
- **On Windows (experimental): Collie judges a custom state or config folder by what is really in it.** A folder counted as Collie's own, and so had its permissions repaired, when it held files such as `.env.production` or `audit.log.x`, or a `fonts` or `uploads` folder of your own things. Now only Collie's own file names and temporary files count, and a `fonts`, `uploads`, `beacons` or `acl-backups` folder counts only when it holds Collie's kind of file. A link or a junction never counts. ([c7de435b](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/c7de435b))
- **On Windows (experimental): the `icacls` lines Collie prints work in PowerShell for a path with `$` or a backtick.** Inside double quotes PowerShell reads `$name` as a variable, so a pasted fix or restore line could act on the wrong path. Such a path is now printed in single quotes. ([2044068a](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/2044068a))
- **On Windows (experimental): `collie start` refuses a path with a `%` in it.** Task Scheduler reads `%NAME%` in a task as an environment variable and has no way to write a literal `%`, so a task for a folder such as `C:\pct%TEMP%dir` ran another path, or did not start at all. `start` now says which path holds the `%`, writes no task, and asks you to move Collie and its config folder. ([b29df4ad](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/b29df4ad))
- **On Windows (experimental): `collie stop` checks that the bridge really stopped.** Windows can refuse to end a program that runs as another account or as administrator, and `stop` used to report success anyway. It now looks again after a moment, names each Collie program still running, keeps its record, and says to close it in Task Manager and run the same command again. `restart` and `uninstall` name themselves in that last step. ([eb17d9eb](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/eb17d9eb))
- **On Windows (experimental): `collie start` waits until Collie answers.** It used to print `bridge started` as soon as Task Scheduler took the job, even when no bridge came up. It now waits, as `collie restart` does, and fails with the steps to take when nothing answers. ([a318c5d2](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/a318c5d2))
- **The update check and `install.ps1` read every page of release tags.** GitHub lists 100 tags a page and the repository has about 92, so the next releases would soon have landed on a second page that nothing read, and a new release could go unseen. The release picked today does not change. ([3553dbeb](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/3553dbeb))
- **On Windows (experimental): the `local-cli` voice provider ends the command's whole process tree.** At the 60-second limit, at the stdout cap and after a clean exit, Collie runs `taskkill /T` and then ends any process the command left behind, so an engine started by a wrapper no longer outlives it. Before, only the command itself was killed. A process started by a helper that has already exited can still outlive it. ([2b1a8473](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/2b1a8473))

## [1.15.3] - 2026-10-02

### Fixed

- **A folder on Windows no longer reads as "no folder".** The Changes view only accepted a path that
  started with `/`, so every Windows folder was refused. It now reads a path the way the host does, and
  the install check, the link check and the update smoke test find `collie.exe` instead of a bare
  `collie`. On macOS a folder reached through `/tmp` or `/var` now maps to its repo. ([f70595f8](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/f70595f8), [20d1e6d5](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/20d1e6d5))
- **A lead behind `tailscale serve` now tells a new member to dial port 443.** `crew add` and
  `crew invite` handed the member the bare tailnet name, and `collie join` reads a bare host as the
  lead's own listener on port 8787. A default HTTPS lead listens on loopback and publishes only 443,
  so the member saw "Unable to connect". Both now give `https://<full-tailnet-name>`, or
  `<name>:<port>` when `COLLIE_SERVE_PORT` moved the front door. With `COLLIE_SERVE_MODE=http`,
  `invite` keeps the short name. Thanks @sbakhour (#334). ([228f65ee](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/228f65ee))
- **`collie crew join --address` now needs a port.** A portless `--address` made the lead dial port 443 on the member, so a member whose
  address had no port stayed unreachable with nothing naming the cause. `join` now refuses it and
  suggests `--address <host>:<port>`. An `https://host:8787` address is still accepted and stored
  as `host:8787`, while `https://host` with no port and any `http://` address are refused. For a
  peer row that cannot be dialled, `crew status` now names `collie crew set-address <member>
  <host:port>`. `crew status` and `doctor` print the exact `set-address` command for a stored
  address without a port. ([228f65ee](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/228f65ee), [58cd66af](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/58cd66af))
- **A failed TLS dial now says which way it failed.** Every TLS failure read "the TLS certificate
  was not accepted". A certificate that is not the pinned one now reads "something other than the
  pinned member answered at this address", which is what a wrong port looks like. A name mismatch
  and an expired or not yet valid certificate each get their own sentence. ([228f65ee](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/228f65ee))
- **A fresh omp session no longer shows a draft in the terminal.** omp 18.4 paints a key hint,
  Shift+Tab to change thinking effort, into an empty editor. The omp reader took the hint's key
  glyphs for a typed draft, so every new session showed "Draft in terminal" with Take over. The
  reader now knows the hint's shape in all three composer layouts and reads the editor as empty.
  Thanks @enieuwy (#320). ([e3887c1d](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/e3887c1d), [487f70b0](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/487f70b0), [73f417cd](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/73f417cd))

## [1.15.2+collie.1] - 2026-10-02

### Changed

- **Collie follows upstream with clearer Chat and reliable agent dialogs.** Merge v1.15.2 with OpenCode question cards, folded compaction summaries and lifecycle fixes, preserving Collie controls and current agent adaptations. ([880d26f8](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/880d26f8))

## [1.15.2] - 2026-10-02

### Fixed

- **A working Claude pane no longer shows "Collie cannot read this dialog".** Claude Code's default
  footer prints `esc to interrupt` while a turn runs and `↓ to manage` while a background task or
  monitor exists. Collie took both for a modal's key hints, found no input box, and drew the Escape
  card over a live composer, where the reply path then refused to type. A pane with a custom
  statusline never showed it, which is why no capture in the corpus had the footer. Those two hints,
  and their clipped forms on a narrow pane, now read as the composer's own status, and a real
  `Esc to cancel` footer still refuses. Thanks @aryanscaler (#330). ([63bf5b61](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/63bf5b61))

## [1.15.1] - 2026-10-02

### Added

- **The Chat view shows what a question tool asked, with its options.** An opencode `question` call or a Claude Code AskUserQuestion reaches the phone with its questions, their options and, once answered, the labels chosen, instead of a bare tool name, and while it waits the card points at the dialog below the stream (#329). ([10a383c9](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/10a383c9))

### Changed

- **A compaction is one marker line in a session view, and its recap is off by default.** When an
  agent compacts its context it writes a recap of the whole session for itself. Chat drew that as a
  centred wall of text and History as a full card, thousands of characters nobody reads on a phone,
  all built into the page. Both views now draw "Context compacted" and the time, and the text is
  never built. Turn the recap back on under Settings → Appearance → Compaction summaries, or in a
  pane's Display sheet, and it folds behind the marker and opens on a tap. A find on History always
  reaches it. Long machine notes fold behind a System label as well. ([ec93cae6](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/ec93cae6))

### Fixed

- **Updating on Windows works with the community supervisor.** With the community Task Scheduler
  supervisor, `collie restart` stops only the bridge process it recorded and the supervisor
  relaunches it, where it used to fail on a `bin/collie` that Windows names `collie.exe`. The build
  steps the running `collie.exe` aside to `.old` before the swap, because Windows refuses to rename
  onto a running executable, and the bridge finds `bin/collie.exe`, so the phone's Update button can
  run there. Windows stays community-supported and best effort. Thanks @mqmalagris (#309). ([0debdcc4](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/0debdcc4), [c942047b](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/c942047b), [2c96e76b](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/2c96e76b), [039a4b11](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/039a4b11), [eb1fd1ca](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/eb1fd1ca), [a0017871](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/a0017871))
- **Switching a pane to Chat lands with the turns already there.** Choosing Chat from the pane menu
  used to swap the body at once, onto an empty box, and the turns popped in after it. Chat now reads
  the session while the pane menu or the Display sheet is open, so the swap happens as the sheet
  closes. If that read has not come, the terminal stays up for at most a second and a half. ([6ca7b5a4](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/6ca7b5a4))
- **A Windows restart reports it when the bridge never comes back.** On Windows with the community
  supervisor, `collie restart` waits for the bridge to answer, 30 seconds unless
  `COLLIE_UPDATE_HEALTH_TIMEOUT_MS` says longer. If nothing answers, it now exits with an error that
  points to `collie status` and `collie-ctl.ps1 logs`, where it used to report success. An update run
  in a terminal then no longer prints `✓ update complete`, though the new version may already be
  installed, and a slow machine can come up a few seconds after the error. The phone's Update button
  keeps its own health check and its one rollback. Windows stays community-supported and best effort. ([29760622](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/29760622))
- **A quiet tuios shell is named a shell, not an id.** Until a program sets a title, tuios fills the
  window title with `Terminal` and the first eight characters of the window id, and Collie passed
  that on as the terminal title, so every such pane read as "Terminal 6247db65" on the phone. The
  placeholder is now dropped and the pane reads as a shell, as on tmux and zellij. Thanks
  @Gaurav-Gosain (#328). ([20df9596](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/20df9596))
- **An opencode question dialog can be answered from the phone.** A single-select question shows as
  a card with one button per option, and a tap sends that option's digit. A multi-select question
  shows its options as checkboxes: a tap toggles one, a button moves on to the Confirm tab, and
  Confirm lists the answers with a button to submit them and one to dismiss the dialog, which ends the
  turn. A call with several questions shows each question as a step with its tabs, and the same
  Confirm tab ends it. Before, every one of these showed as raw terminal text that no button could
  answer. The card locks while the free-text row is open, because the terminal takes digits as text
  there, and Collie never types into that row. A list of more than nine options stays on the
  terminal mirror, with the Escape card to dismiss it (#329). ([199d31f5](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/199d31f5))

## [1.15.0+collie.2] - 2026-10-02

### Fixed

- **Quick and Agent controls share the Display sheet layout.** Use the same bottom sheet title, surface and viewport anchoring; show five command rows by default with the rest available by scrolling. ([8bc63510](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/8bc63510))

## [1.15.0+collie.1] - 2026-10-01

### Changed

- **Collie follows upstream with Chat and clearer device controls.** Merge v1.15.0, adopt grouped Settings and the Display sheet, and preserve compact controls, current agent cards, Cursor history and screenshot evidence. ([e5786f9a](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/e5786f9a))

## [1.15.0] - 2026-10-01

### Added

- **The journal now says what a tool call did, not only what it was asked to do.** Every tool part
  carries a structured `call` beside its one-line summary: an edit knows its path, its diff hunks
  and how many lines moved, a command knows its exit code, a read knows its range. A refused call is
  marked `denied` rather than lumped in with a real failure, because "you said no" and "it crashed"
  are not the same thing to read. The shape is additive, so every existing view keeps working, and
  the name table is shared, so `Bash`, `bash`, `shell` and `exec_command` are one kind of thing. ([d5faea94](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d5faea94))

- **Settings is four sections instead of one long column.** The page was seventeen cards deep on a
  phone with no headings to skim by, so finding one switch meant reading every card above it. It is
  an index now: Appearance, Device, Alerts and System, each short enough to take in at once. No
  setting is removed and none changes what it does. Back from a section returns to the index. The
  QR `collie pair` prints still opens the pairing form, which now lives under System. ([7527b53e](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/7527b53e))

- **Tool calls are off in a session view, and that is the new default.** A working session is
  mostly tool calls: one turn can be forty reads and a grep, which buried the paragraph you opened
  the page for. The History page now draws what the agent SAID, with one muted line per turn saying
  how many steps it took and a tap to bring them back. A find always overrides it, so a search that
  matches inside a command's output still shows what it matched. Turn them back on for good under
  Settings → Appearance → Tool calls. ([b36b7c55](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/b36b7c55))

- **A pane that becomes an agent pane says so.** You are watching a bare shell on your phone, you
  type `opencode` at your desk, and the Collie mark flies out of the header, blooms over the mirror
  and hands the pane to the agent's own mark. It marks a fact the poll has already found, so it
  never reads as progress, it holds no space and moves nothing, a tap ends it, and under reduced
  motion it is a still picture instead. Opening a pane that was already running an agent announces
  nothing: it is the change that is drawn, never the state. ([36063545](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/36063545))

- **The boot splash shows the Collie mark, not the old galloping dog.** The sprite was retired when
  the new mark landed and every screen moved to it, but the first-paint splash in `index.html` kept
  its own hand-written copy, so a cold open still flashed a galloping dog and then swapped it for a
  different animal. It is the brand's own header-weight mark now, in a light and a dark file, so the
  hand-off to React changes nothing but the mark's own motion. ([2dd6ca80](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/2dd6ca80))

- **Every harness now records what a tool call DID, not just that one ran.** Claude already did;
  Codex, opencode, pi, grok and hermes now do too. A command carries its exit code, an edit carries
  its hunks and its added and removed counts, a search carries its hit count, and a call the
  operator refused is marked as refused rather than as an error. Nothing is guessed: each harness
  fills only what its own record actually holds, and the three that write no exit code and no patch
  say so rather than inventing one. This is what a session card will draw, and it is read from one
  place for all six. ([0a143094](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/0a143094))

- **The pane switcher can run by activity instead of by place.** The sheet you open with the layers
  mark keeps every pane in its space and tab, which is the right answer when you know where you are
  going and the wrong one when you just want the pane you were last in. A Place / Activity toggle now
  sits at the top of it, and Activity folds the space headings and the Shells fold into one list,
  newest first, counting both the agent's own last turn and the last time you were in the pane. The
  choice is a standing one and also a row under Settings → Appearance → Pane order. It reads the
  clock once, when the sheet opens, so a pane that finishes a turn while you are reaching for a row
  repaints where it stands and never moves under your thumb. ([cf10b860](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/cf10b860))

- **The journal reads a session one row at a time.** Every harness adapter now folds its log row by
  row instead of only parsing a whole file, and says which earlier turns a row changed as well as
  which turns it added. That second half is the point: a tool result lands rows after the call it
  belongs to, so attaching it edits a turn that is already on screen. A live session that gains one
  row can now cost one row of work instead of re-reading and re-parsing the last 32 MB of a log that
  can be 187 MB long. Nothing you can see changes yet, and the whole-file reading is the same reading
  it always was, proved for all six harnesses against the same bytes arriving in torn random chunks. ([a417a46d](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/a417a46d))

- **Asking a session what is new now costs only what is new.** Every harness can answer that
  question in the language its own storage speaks: the four that write a log file count bytes, and
  the two that keep a SQLite database count a row's own clock or its row id. The reader above them
  learns none of that, so a harness can change how it counts without anything else changing. Three
  things follow. A first read takes a bounded tail instead of a whole session, which starts to matter
  once a log runs to hundreds of megabytes, as a long Claude session does. A row the agent is halfway
  through writing is held back
  until the newline arrives, so it is never shown half and never dropped. And a read that cannot
  simply continue, because a log was truncated or because Claude handed the conversation over to a
  new file, says so in one word and hands back the truth instead of a guess. Nothing you can see
  changes yet. ([7953e9c8](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/7953e9c8))

- **A watching screen asks what is new and is told only that.** A new read answers a pane's session
  the way a poll wants it answered: the turns you have not seen, the turns that changed since you
  last looked, and nothing else. A poll that finds nothing new sends no body at all. The bridge holds
  a bounded tail per session, about two megabytes of it, so a session of any length costs the same
  memory, and older turns come off the disk only when somebody asks for them. It rides the poll
  Collie already has rather than a new socket, so it crosses a crew link exactly as the history read
  does, and a member one release behind simply reports no such read instead of an empty session.
  Nothing you can see changes yet. ([c75ced6e](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/c75ced6e))

- **The pane menu can copy a pane's output.** There was no way to get the terminal text off a
  phone at all: an installed iOS PWA suppresses long-press selection app-wide unless an element asks
  for it back, and the mirror never did. Two ways in now. The mirror opts back into selection, so
  long-press and Copy works. And a Copy output row joins Find and History in the pane menu, which
  copies the whole buffer in one tap, unwrapped, so a paste reads as real lines rather than as the
  phone's own hard wraps. The row copies the screen you are looking at, not a poll that landed under
  your thumb, and it stays hidden where there is no output or no clipboard to write to, which is
  every plain-HTTP deploy. Thanks @jyothyswaroop (#287). ([d5057d23](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d5057d23))

- **A push notification arrives in the language you picked.** The bridge writes a notification title,
  and the bridge has no idea which language your phone is set to, so a German device still read an
  English line on its lock screen. The bridge now sends a short catalogue code beside the English
  title. The page leaves the active language's templates in Cache Storage, and the service worker
  fills them in there, which is the only place that runs when the app is closed. Any miss falls back
  to the English title, so a phone that has not opened the app since you changed language still gets
  a readable notice instead of a code. Thanks @jaehyun2yo (#310). ([ffd600cb](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/ffd600cb))

- **A canary run now checks what Chat reads, not only what the screen shows.** Each of the six
  journal readers counts the row kinds and content kinds it has no branch for, and `bun run canary`
  reads the session each agent wrote in its own pane: a user item for the prompt the canary sent, a
  tool item for the file read it asked for, a reply below it, and nothing unrecognised. Above zero
  the run fails and NAMES the type, which is a gate against a vendor format change nobody has
  written a test for. Claude Code and Codex both broke reading on the day they shipped, while
  every test stayed green. No session file is saved anywhere, not even under `/tmp`: an
  agent's log carries file contents from every read and environment from every command, so only
  counts and item kinds are kept. `verified-versions.json` records the journal reader's verified
  version beside the screen reader's and `bun run harness:drift` prints a row per reader, because
  the two drift apart: a vendor can change what it paints without changing what it writes. ([160d2fab](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/160d2fab))

- **The phone can now read a working session and hold it correctly.** It asks a pane's session what
  moved and merges the answer by turn, so a turn that changed is written over where it already sits
  and never drawn a second time lower down. An unchanged poll costs nothing and changes nothing. A
  machine still running an older Collie has no such read at all, and it now says so and names the
  remedy instead of looking like a pane with nothing to show. No screen uses this yet. ([a2231ee1](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/a2231ee1))

- **Collie now holds the blocks a session reads as.** A turn from an agent's own record becomes what
  you would expect to see: your own turn, the reply, thinking behind a fold, and a card per step. A
  command carries its output, an edit carries its diff in the same colours the Changes view uses, and
  a run of steps folds to one line you can open. They were drawn and lived with in the session-stream
  prototype first and moved here whole, tests included, so there is one definition of a card and not
  two. No screen mounts them yet. ([c126f4fa](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/c126f4fa))

- **A pane can be read as a chat instead of a terminal.** Turn Chat on under Settings →
  Experiments, and a pane draws the agent's own conversation: your turns, its replies, thinking
  behind a fold and a card per step, with the composer, the belt and the pane menu exactly where
  they were, so you still take the work over by typing. The switch is a row in the pane's ⋮ menu and
  the choice is one standing setting for the whole device. Older turns load on a tap. A pane with no
  session keeps the terminal and the row says why, and a crew member a release behind says to update
  it rather than pretending there is nothing to show. Terminal stays the default; the default flips
  in 2.0 (#316). ([2e46ea22](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/2e46ea22))

- **The pane switcher can sort by which prompt cache dies first.** A third order beside Place and
  Activity, and the one with a deadline in it: the pane you should go to next is often neither the
  one you just left nor the one asking for you, it is the one whose cache you are about to pay to
  rebuild. A pane with no cache left to lose sinks to the bottom in its usual order. Like Activity,
  the order is read once when you open the sheet and held there, so a window ticking down never
  pulls a row out from under your thumb. ([f0e5856f](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/f0e5856f))

- **Chat shows the work a codex pane did, not only the words it said.** Codex runs nearly everything
  through one custom tool, and the journal reader dropped that shape, so every file it read and every
  patch it wrote was missing from Chat. It reads now, with the command, the output and the exit code.
  Claude's pasted images reach the phone too, and an OpenCode patch or attachment shows as itself. ([38a93df6](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/38a93df6))

- **Chat says a turn is still running, and shows what you queued behind it.** A compaction writes no
  row for minutes, so a compacting pane in Chat looked exactly like a finished one, and a message
  typed while the agent was busy appeared nowhere at all. The thread now ends with a working mark, and
  the queue sits under it in your own colour until the agent takes it. ([c906c453](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/c906c453))

- **Collie drives tuios, as an experimental backend.** Set `COLLIE_MUX=tuios` to mirror a tuios
  daemon's sessions as spaces, its workspaces as tabs and its windows as panes, with the agent, its
  state and its conversation read from tuios itself. It needs tuios 0.8.3 or newer. The mux
  contract now also says that an agent name is one of Collie's harness names or `shell`. Thanks
  @Gaurav-Gosain (#321, #322). ([c1928e3d](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/c1928e3d))

### Changed

- **The theme card is called Theme.** It was called Appearance, which is now the name of the
  section it sits in, and a page that says Appearance twice tells you nothing the second time. ([7527b53e](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/7527b53e))

- **The canary runs pi the way an operator runs it.** pi was launched with `--no-session`, so it
  wrote no session file, so the journal check spec 05 added could never see pi at all. The flag is
  gone. pi was also the only agent exempt: Claude, Codex and opencode already write to their own
  stores on every canary run, because the canary isolates Herdr and deliberately leaves an agent's
  own configuration alone. `--thinking off` stays, because that one only makes a run cheaper. ([71cbe684](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/71cbe684))

- **A canary ledger entry is judged per agent, not per run.** One agent failing used to block the
  ledger for every agent in the run. The run on 2026-09-30 showed the cost: a Codex three versions
  behind painted its update picker over the composer and failed one scenario, which blocked the
  entries for Claude 2.1.285 and opencode 1.18.33, both of which had passed all six of their own
  scenarios and were the two versions the drift check was asking about. Another vendor's startup
  prompt is not evidence about our Claude reader. A run with any failure is still a failed run. ([a4dfd913](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/a4dfd913))

- **Claude Code 2.1.285, opencode 1.18.33 and pi 0.87.1 are verified, for both readers.** The canary
  ran all six scenarios against each of them, idle, drafts, sends, journal, narrow and start-exit,
  and every one passed. `journal` is the new scenario: it parses the canary's own session with the
  same adapter Chat uses, and asserts the kinds it finds. The ledger now carries two lines per
  agent, the screen reader's and the journal reader's, so `bun run harness:drift` covers Chat as
  well as the mirror. ([926a03e4](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/926a03e4))

- **The canary's journal prompt cannot be answered without opening the file.** It used to say "read
  README.md, then reply with only OK", and "OK" needs nothing from the file, so an agent was free to
  skip the very tool call the scenario exists to watch. Codex did exactly that, on two versions. The
  canary's own README now carries a token, and the prompt asks for the token it names, which no
  agent can answer without reading. The reply is still one word. ([d0411bef](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d0411bef))

- **Codex 0.159.2 is verified, for both readers.** The canary ran idle, drafts, sends, journal and
  narrow against it and every one passed. The journal scenario saw Codex's `custom_tool_call` and
  counted no row it does not know, so the ledger now names 0.159.2 for the screen reader and for
  the journal reader, which had been last swept at 0.156.1. ([3bbd7863](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/3bbd7863))

### Fixed

- **A long file name in Changes keeps both ends instead of losing its start.** The tree truncated a
  name from the left, which is correct for a path and wrong for a bare file name, so a folder of
  long names drew every row as `…m_breaks_under_podman_compose.md` with the very prefix that orders
  them cut off. A name now gives up its MIDDLE: the start and the extension both stay, the way a
  file manager does it. Compacted folder rows keep both ends too, so two repos holding the same deep
  folder chain no longer read as the same row. ([fe7015b0](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/fe7015b0))

- **A two-pane box pans on a phone instead of losing its right half.** Claude Code's dynamic-workflow
  view draws the phases in a left pane and the running agents in a right one, and on a phone every row
  of it was cut off at the screen edge: the report showed a band of stacked rules with `· 74…` hanging
  off the side. The mirror only ever panned a box whose divider crossed a rule, `┼`, and a two-pane box
  never draws one, so it was refused and then clipped rather than wrapped. It now pans like any other
  wide table, which also gives back the model names in omp's `/model` picker and the Tips beside omp's
  welcome logo. Thanks @cryptiklemur (discussion #301). ([8c811438](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/8c811438))

- **A pi turn that failed now says so, instead of vanishing.** When a provider call errors, pi
  writes the turn with no content at all, so the failure was not merely unexplained, the turn was
  simply missing from the history. The message pi recorded now shows as a note under the turn, set
  apart from anything the agent said, and an interrupted turn says so too while keeping whatever the
  model got out first. Measured over 44 real sessions before the fix: 37 errored turns, every one of
  them empty, and 15 interrupted ones. ([d2a0dec4](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d2a0dec4))

- **A pi session you rewound shows the path you are on, not both paths.** pi keeps every branch in
  one file, and Collie was reading all of it, so History showed the turns you had abandoned mixed in
  with the live ones and nothing said which was which. It now follows the branch you are actually on,
  and rewinding back onto a path you left brings it back. Eight of forty-four real sessions had
  forked, so this was the common case rather than the corner. ([d2a0dec4](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d2a0dec4))

- **pi's compaction, its branch summaries and a desk command all show up now.** Collie read only
  pi's message rows, so a compacted conversation read as though nothing had happened, an extension's
  own note never appeared, and a `!command` you ran at the desk looked like a message you had typed.
  Each now reads as what it is, set apart from anything the agent said. ([d2a0dec4](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d2a0dec4))

- **A panel drawn over opencode's composer no longer reads as a draft.** When another panel's box
  border crosses the composer bar, the draft walk could land on that border row and hand it back as
  the draft, so the phone showed a Draft in terminal card holding one line of box glyphs, and Take
  over would have typed that junk into the composer. A border row is excluded now, and it takes two
  conditions to be one: a corner or a junction on the row's interior, AND nothing but chrome inside
  it. Either condition on its own gets a real draft wrong. People type a bare rule inside a message,
  and a pasted `tree` carries a junction on every line, which read four typed lines back as the last
  one. The reader also held two glyph sets that disagreed about whether `─` and `│` were border
  glyphs, and there is one set now. Thanks @AndiWandHerd (#319). ([ed705820](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/ed705820))

- **Two Chinese catalogues said a cache had expired when it had only gone cold.** A cold cache still
  works, it only costs more, so the word carries a fact. The Simplified Chinese notification setting
  read 缓存即将失效, which claims the cache became invalid, while the two strings next to it already
  said 变冷. Traditional Chinese said 冷卻 where its own neighbours say 變冷, which was consistency
  rather than fact. Both now use the wording their catalogue already uses everywhere else. ([1f46ffcf](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/1f46ffcf))

- **German, Japanese and Korean said a cache had expired, and German said it was idle.** The same
  wrong fact sat in three strings in each of those catalogues. German is the worst of the three:
  "inaktiv" is German's own word for an IDLE pane, so one word named two different states. Each
  catalogue now uses the word its own cache chip already uses, "kalt" in German, コールド in Japanese
  and 콜드 in Korean. Nothing was newly translated; the word was already in the file. ([89724bc5](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/89724bc5))

- **A notification about a finished agent now uses the same word as the app.** German said "ist
  fertig" and Spanish "ha terminado", while the status chip in the app says "abgeschlossen" and
  "completado". Every other push title matches its chip, so these two were the exception. Both carry
  the chip's word now, with an object, because German "ist abgeschlossen" is wrong for an actor and a
  bare "hat abgeschlossen" can be read as having locked up. ([89724bc5](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/89724bc5))

- **A send on a Muse pane could type your message and then never submit it.** With block grammars
  on, tapping Send typed the text into the composer and stalled, three taps in a row, while the
  words sat in the box. The verify read after typing can catch the terminal's echo one character
  short, and the matcher accepted that prefix, so the phone bound a partial row and the bridge's own
  exact check then refused to submit it. A single-chunk send now waits for the echo's tail before it
  binds, which is what the multi-chunk loop already did. Thanks @jpcarranza94 (#312). ([1791674b](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/1791674b))

- **`collie status` sees a launchd agent that Home Manager put in the user domain.** Collie probed
  only `gui/<uid>`, so an agent declared with `domain = "user"`, which is what a background service
  without a graphical login needs, read as not loaded while it was running. Both domains are probed
  now, the status line names the full target, and both registrations are reported when both exist,
  so a running background agent is not hidden behind a stopped GUI one. The pidfile fallback is
  unchanged. Thanks @mavam (#314). ([623401a6](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/623401a6))

- **A URL an agent typed as itself is now a link you can tap.** Agents write a bare address
  constantly, a server they started or a pull request they opened, and only a Markdown link ever
  became an anchor. A bare `http://`, `https://` or `mailto:` is now one too, in History and in Chat.
  It keeps the sentence punctuation it ended on, so a URL at the end of a sentence does not swallow
  the full stop, and a URL inside backticks stays code. ([8ab22bcc](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/8ab22bcc))

- **Prose reads better: code wears the docs site's blue chip, and your own turns are findable.**
  Inline code was grey ink on a grey wash inside grey prose, with nothing to scan for. It now wears
  the same blue chip `colliepwa.dev` draws around a command, so one command looks like one thing
  wherever you read it. A short hash also stopped splitting mid-word across two lines, `6c` on one
  and `70894d` on the next, and a long token now breaks only when it cannot fit a line of its own.
  Your own turns carry the brand's orange as a wash, so scrolling back for what you asked is a
  glance rather than a read. ([8ab22bcc](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/8ab22bcc))

- **Loading older turns in Chat keeps your place instead of throwing you to the top.** The tap puts
  forty turns in above what you are reading, and the scroller held its offset, so the block you were
  on slid down by the whole height of the new page. It gives that height back once the page paints,
  the way History's own scrollback and the terminal mirror's already did. ([1712ec61](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/1712ec61))

- **A bulleted list now reads at the same pace as a paragraph.** A list took the base line height
  and a paragraph took the relaxed one, so the same prose was set two different ways depending on
  whether it had a bullet in front of it. A list was also the one place a code chip did not fit its
  line: two chips on consecutive wrapped lines touched. Lists and block quotes take the paragraph's
  own leading now, and the chip is a millimetre shorter so it sits inside the line rather than
  pushing it apart. ([30f2ac31](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/30f2ac31))

- **A flag or a branch name in backticks is no longer cut in half at the line end.** A hyphen, a
  slash and a colon are ordinary places for a line to break, so `--force` could come out as `--`
  then `force`, and an address like `http://bluefin:8788` could be split across two lines. Anything
  short enough to fit a column of its own now stays in one piece, and only something genuinely too
  long to fit, a full path, breaks where it must. ([37161551](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/37161551))

- **The belt's Display settings answer for the body you are looking at.** Over a Chat stream you got
  the terminal mirror's six rows, of which one did anything, with no way to tell which. The dock now
  carries the Terminal / Chat switch at the top, the same choice the pane's ⋮ menu writes, and below
  it the rows that apply: text size and tool calls for Chat, the mirror's five for the terminal.
  Text size comes first in both instead of last under five switches, and Chat's size is its own
  number, so a stream you can read does not mean a terminal you cannot. ([299fc465](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/299fc465))

- **The belt's Display settings open as a sheet, so nothing under them moves.** They rode an in-flow
  panel that took its height out of the pane body, so opening the settings pushed the very thing you
  opened them to look at, and the terminal and Chat lists are different lengths, so switching bodies
  pushed it again. It is the pane switcher's own sheet now: it covers, and nothing above it shifts. ([71c096dc](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/71c096dc))

- **Tool calls off now actually hides them in a live session.** The setting folded a run of steps to
  one line, and then a step that was still running opened the run again and kept it open for good.
  In a live session almost every run is running at some point, so the setting looked like it did
  nothing. A running step no longer overrules the choice. Your own tap still opens any run. ([6563ed77](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/6563ed77))

- **The pane switcher gives two rows back to the panes.** The alarm line and the order control each
  took a full row of a phone sheet, above a heading, before the first pane. They now share one row,
  with the order as glyphs. The heading below still names the order in words, so nothing is lost. ([f0e5856f](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/f0e5856f))

- **Chat says when a turn is still running, so a compaction is not an empty screen.** The terminal
  mirror shows the agent's own spinner, but Chat draws the agent's record, and a record gains nothing
  while a session compacts. So a pane that had been busy for minutes looked exactly like a finished
  one. The thread now ends with a working mark until the next turn lands. ([43827305](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/43827305))

- **A phone paired under a name outside ASCII can reach a crew member again.** A header value must
  be plain bytes, so a label like `폰` made every forwarded call fail with a 500 before it left the
  lead. A name like that now travels percent-encoded (RFC 8187) and the member reads it back whole,
  for its allowlist and its audit line. An ASCII name is sent exactly as before. Reported by
  @dmstjd1024 (#324). ([06374508](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/06374508))

- **A Codex pane pursuing a goal keeps its input box.** A Codex `/goal` puts `Pursuing goal (…)`
  at the right end of the status row, and Codex paints the spaces in front of it in the colour of
  the field before. Collie read that as a row it did not know, so it lost the input box: the pane
  showed the unread-dialog card and every reply from the phone was refused. The padding now reads
  as the gap it is. Reported with a capture by @CorrectRoadH (#317). ([ed647185](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/ed647185))

- **The canary judges the read send by its token and starts codex without its update prompt.**
  The `sends` scenario accepted only a bare "OK" as an answer, so a codex that replied with the
  README token the read prompt asks for still timed out. A message can now declare its expected
  reply. Separately, codex's "Update available" prompt (default answer: Update now) took the place
  of the composer at startup, so the canary now launches codex with
  `check_for_update_on_startup=false`. ([9dd96df0](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/9dd96df0))

### Docs

- **The docs have a Guides section, and it opens with an install in five minutes.** Install was
  the only way in, and it answers every system and every front door at once, so a first-time reader
  had to find their own path through it. The new guide walks one path: Tailscale, Herdr and the
  install script on the computer, then the home screen and `collie pair` on the phone. The README's
  documentation table splits into Guides and Reference, and `collie docs five-minute-install` prints
  the guide from the binary. ([9243abd2](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/9243abd2))

- **Every Settings path in the docs names its section.** The settings page became an index of four
  sections, so fifteen instructions across seven pages pointed at a card that had moved. Paired
  devices and Updates are under System, the harness shortcuts, the typeface and the language are
  under Appearance, and zen and Changes are under Device. Two were wrong twice over: one told you
  to open Appearance and pick a theme, which is now the Theme card inside that section, and two
  named a "notifications" section that never existed and is called Alerts. ([95bf1b74](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/95bf1b74))

- **Changes has its own docs page, and the README names it as a feature.** The view was
  documented only as one section of the Configure page, which said it opens from the pane menu and
  never updates on its own. Both had stopped being true. `docs/changes.md` covers both ways in, the
  list, the diff, the last commit, the 5-second refresh, how the folder and nested repos are found,
  the read-only rules and the limits. `collie docs changes` prints it from the binary. ([1948ef6b](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/1948ef6b))

## [1.14.2+collie.18] - 2026-09-30

### Added

- **Card regressions retain phone screenshots and broader live evidence.** The isolated harness saves optional 320px replay images linked to ANSI captures and verdicts, adds focused approval/question probes and current statusline/trust/menu checks, and supports selecting agents without rerunning unrelated model turns. ([38675d78](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/38675d78))

## [1.14.2+collie.17] - 2026-09-30

### Fixed

- **Codex input and Agents cards handle current terminal states.** A custom status line with a right-aligned warning no longer duplicates the input area, and repeated task names remain selectable in the Agents card. ([7fa4c8da](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/7fa4c8da))

## [1.14.2+collie.16] - 2026-09-30

### Added

- **Adaptation checks track card health after CLI updates.** An inventory links 46 adaptations to sources, tests and captured evidence. The optional macOS hourly watcher reuses isolated Codex and Claude card probes when versions or relevant sources change, reports unverified coverage separately, and notifies only on health changes. Partial canaries and known gaps cannot certify an entire CLI version. ([6779a2a2](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/6779a2a2))

### Fixed

- **Codex model and fork cards read current terminal layouts.** Recognize compact model/reasoning/statusline footers and label-only bold selection, match recent versioned GPT model names uniquely across casing changes while keeping custom IDs exact, and accept Fork's action-specific toolbar and density hint. ([6779a2a2](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/6779a2a2))
- **Claude Settings cards recognize plain horizontal modal boundaries.** Status, Config, Usage and Stats stay in their fixed scrolling cards instead of falling back or being claimed by the generic menu reader. ([6779a2a2](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/6779a2a2))
- **Claude Agents cards preserve positions in compact native lists.** Hidden empty groups and repeated truncated titles retain native navigation order, while background selection and the current conversation remain distinct. The isolated probe cancels recognized native screens even when they include a new-session input box. ([6779a2a2](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/6779a2a2))

## [1.14.2+collie.15] - 2026-09-30

### Changed

- **The iOS home-screen icon uses a finished sable Collie.** Smooth vector edges, cream markings, and a transparent background preserve the existing silhouette and orbit. The 180 px and 512 px touch icons use the device-tested artwork; Android and development icons keep their existing appearance. ([f6fab37d](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/f6fab37d))

## [1.14.2+collie.14] - 2026-09-29

### Changed

- **The iOS home-screen icon uses the existing artwork inverted.** The release touch icon keeps every pixel in place and reverses its colors to provide a light-source candidate for iOS appearance processing; automatic switching still requires real-device verification. ([910bb199](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/910bb199))

## [1.14.2+collie.13] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed

- **Agent card titles and message snippets wrap within their rows.** Compact pickers no longer treat text after a separator as a nonwrapping status badge, and shared option buttons constrain long words and paths to the card width while retaining bounded list scrolling. ([c966314a](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/c966314a))

## [1.14.2+collie.12] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- **Claude background agents become a compact navigable card.** The left-arrow session list reuses the shared five-row scrolling picker, walks native group headings before opening a session, and keeps earlier conversation outside the card. ([45ce8310](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/45ce8310))

### Changed

- **Escape controls use a quieter compact keycap.** Fixed scrolling cards retain a 44px touch target while the visible key loses its oversized frame. ([45ce8310](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/45ce8310))

## [1.14.2+collie.11] - 2026-09-29

### Changed

- **Claude settings content stays inside a fixed-size card.** Status, Config, Usage, and Stats share a bounded 320px viewport with horizontal and vertical scrolling, a fixed title and Escape control, and earlier conversation preserved outside the card. ([244a43cf](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/244a43cf))

## [1.14.2+collie.10] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed

- **Claude settings tabs share one compact Escape card.** Keep Status, Config, Usage, and Stats in the full-width mirror with the same 50px docked control, including Stats loading and chart views, while rejecting historical or unhighlighted tab text. ([ef39c6a9](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/ef39c6a9))

## [1.14.2+collie.9] - 2026-09-29

### Changed

- **Unrecognized interfaces show a compact caption beside their key.** Use consistent wording across all seven languages and a single 50px row with a 44px Escape touch target, keeping the terminal mirror visible and existing guarded key behavior. ([af3914bf](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/af3914bf))

## [1.14.2+collie.8] - 2026-09-29

### Changed

- **An unreadable dialog keeps its screen in the mirror, and the card shrinks to its key.** Claude's `/status` and other screens Collie cannot read now stay full width and scrollable in the mirror; the docked card holds only the caption and the declared key instead of a clipped copy of the pane. ([8a4e734b](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/8a4e734b))

## [1.14.2+collie.7] - 2026-09-29

### Changed

- **Picker cards share scrolling and comfortable touch targets.** Reuse bounded lists, separate scrollbar gutters, fixed controls, and centered selection across Codex pickers; shared option surfaces keep a 44px minimum without clipping longer answers. ([5acb15b6](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/5acb15b6))

## [1.14.2+collie.6] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed

- **Codex agents keep overlay scrollbars clear of row borders.** Reserve a separate right-hand gutter so iOS scroll indicators do not cover task text, borders, or current-task marks. ([3217f38b](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/3217f38b))

## [1.14.2+collie.5] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed

- **Codex agents fit five compact rows on phone screens.** Remove excess row padding, keep names and metadata on two lines, and center the pointed task whenever the list's scroll limits allow it. ([94ec0a89](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/94ec0a89))

## [1.14.2+collie.4] - 2026-09-29

### Changed

- **Codex agents lists scroll above their task controls.** At most five rows fit in the list; a guarded delete button reads the native shortcut and opens Codex's explicit permanent-delete confirmation. ([bcdfbf5e](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/bcdfbf5e))

## [1.14.2+collie.3] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed

- **Codex agents cards survive preceding terminal scrollback.** Opening the command center from an existing conversation now recognizes the active list while preserving earlier output and guarded native navigation. ([0c1312c5](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/0c1312c5))

## [1.14.2+collie.2] - 2026-09-28

### Added

- **Codex's agent command center opens as a touch-friendly card.** The daemon's `← for agents` list preserves task names, projects, statuses and the current task; browsing, opening and cancelling use guarded native keys. Incomplete or ambiguous lists keep their terminal view. ([5a405637](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/5a405637))

## [1.14.2+collie.1] - 2026-09-28

### Docs

- **A walkthrough for running Claude Code from your phone.** `docs/claude-code-on-your-phone.md`
  keeps Claude Code alive in tmux, Herdr or zellij when SSH drops, covers parallel sessions,
  installation, pairing, replies, the Keys tray and push notifications.
  `collie docs claude-code-on-your-phone` prints it. The complete upstream comparison is recorded
  in `docs/upstream-v1.14.2.md`. ([24f5d280](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/24f5d280))

## [1.14.1+collie.2] - 2026-09-28

### Changed
- **Tabs show the agent running inside them.** A 16px mark appears beside the name when every pane in a tab uses the same agent; mixed and empty tabs keep their text-only label without making the strip taller. ([ee144f0a](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/ee144f0a))

## [1.14.1+collie.1] - 2026-09-27

### Added
- **The canary opens real dialogs and sends to a busy agent.** `bun run canary --dialogs` asks Claude for a Bash command, a WebFetch, an AskUserQuestion and a plan, and Codex for a command and a file edit, then checks the card, the labels and the free-text lock with Collie's readers, presses the declining key where it was measured live and checks the file was not written. It also sends to each agent while Herdr says it is working. Run against the 1.13.1 readers, it fails on the Claude permission pointer on row 2, the amend note, WebFetch and the Codex patch approval. ([b6b2f246](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/b6b2f246))
- **A picture pi shows reaches the live mirror.** pi draws a picture by direct placement, which leaves nothing on the screen Collie reads, so until now its pictures reached the phone only through History. When a pi or Oh My Pi turn finishes, the pane reads the agent's log once and shows that turn's newest picture as one card right after the mirror, where the view already sits. A later turn without a picture removes the card, and older pictures stay in History. A picture a placeholder already shows is not shown twice, and other agents pay no extra read. This closes the gap from #292. Thanks @leiyangyou. ([b6b2f246](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/b6b2f246))
- **A pane can be pinned to the top of the dashboard and the switcher.** Hold a dashboard row or a pane pill, or open the pane's ⋮ menu, and tap Pin to top. Pinned panes lead the Panes, Focus and Changes lists and the switcher, under the summary line, in the dashboard's own order, and a status change never moves them. Each pane is still listed once, and its workspace still counts it. Pins stay on this device, and closing the pane from Collie removes its pin. Thanks @wwilson1017 for the idea (#286). ([b6b2f246](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/b6b2f246))
- **A crew's dashboard can hide a machine.** Open the Machines sheet and turn off Show on the dashboard beside a machine, and its workspaces leave the Panes, Focus and Changes lists. One dimmed chip in the workspace strip stands in for the machine, keeps its most urgent status dot, and shows the machine again on a tap. The machine you are on always shows, a tap on a machine's row still goes there, and pinned panes still lead the list. The summary line, the Focus badge and notifications still count every machine. The choice stays on this device. Thanks @dantebarba for the idea (#288). ([b6b2f246](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/b6b2f246))
- **Each workspace heading on the dashboard opens a new tab.** A "+" now ends every workspace heading on Panes and Focus, after its counts. A tap opens a new tab in that workspace, in the workspace's own folder, and steps into its fresh shell, as the tab strip's "+" does, so a new tab no longer means opening a pane first. In a crew the tab opens on the machine the heading belongs to. A machine whose multiplexer cannot open tabs shows no "+", and a machine that is not taking writes says why when tapped. Each heading is 8px taller to make room. Thanks @dantebarba (#290). ([b6b2f246](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/b6b2f246))
- **OpenCode panes get their own reader.** Collie now finds OpenCode's input box, so a reply is typed, checked on screen and only then submitted, and a draft left in the box shows on the phone. A permission dialog for a shell command, a file edit or a web fetch shows as buttons, Allow once, Allow always and Reject, and the Always allow confirmation that follows it is a second card with Confirm and Cancel. Each button walks OpenCode's own pointer with the arrow key and then presses Enter, and never types a digit. A picker such as the agent list or the command palette gets the one Escape button. Checked on OpenCode 1.18.32 at full width and at 50 columns. Thanks @Gabrielribeiroic (#255). ([b6b2f246](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/b6b2f246))
- **An X on the actions belt empties the text box.** While the phone's text box holds text or an attachment, an X stands at the belt's right end, left of the Changes button, or left of the Switch button on a pane without one. One tap clears the text, the attachments and that pane's saved draft, keeps the keyboard up, and sends nothing to the pane. The X then becomes Undo, which puts all of it back, until the next keystroke, attachment, send, tap on another belt button or pane change. Undo has no timer, so the belt never shifts under a tap on its own. Thanks @dantebarba (#291). ([b6b2f246](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/b6b2f246))
- **The new-space sheet offers the folders you opened before.** Under the Directory field, the sheet lists Favourites, then Recent, for the machine the space goes to. Recent holds the last 8 folders a space was created in, counting only creates that worked and named a folder, and never home. A tap on a row fills the field and creates nothing. The star beside a row moves it to Favourites, up to 12, and a second tap moves it back. Each machine keeps its own list in `folders.json` in its state directory, so every phone and tablet sees the same folders, and a machine on an older version shows no list. Thanks @dantebarba (#289). ([b6b2f246](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/b6b2f246))
- **A hold now shows while you press.** A dashboard row, a pane pill, a workspace chip or a tab starts to press in and tint a moment after your finger lands, and the look fills until the hold opens its menu half a second in, so a hold in progress no longer looks like nothing is happening. A quick tap changes nothing. The look ends as the menu opens, with one short buzz where the phone supports it. With reduced motion, only the tint shows. ([b6b2f246](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/b6b2f246))
- **The dashboard says once that a hold pins a pane.** On the Panes tab, while nothing is pinned and at least three panes show, one quiet line under the summary line reads "Hold a pane to pin it here.", or "Right-click a pane to pin it here." on a device with a mouse. Its X, or your first pin from any screen, removes it for good on that device, also after you unpin everything. ([b6b2f246](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/b6b2f246))

### Fixed
- **Grok 1.0.41 panes send from the phone again.** Grok 1.0.41 adds `Shift+Enter/Opt+Enter:newline` to the key-hint row under its input box while a draft is in it. Collie did not know a hint with two keys joined by `/`, so it lost the input box as soon as the phone typed the message: the send stopped with "Message didn't reach the input box", and the unread-dialog card covered the pane. Collie now reads that hint, and the `Alt` spelling a Linux Grok may print. Every other saved pane reads as before. Thanks @CorrectRoadH for the pane capture (#294). ([b6b2f246](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/b6b2f246))
- **Starting an update no longer shows the previous update as finished.** On a lead that had updated before, "Start update" showed "Update finished" at once, with the clock at 0:00 and the old versions on every row. The real update then showed as "started on another device", and this phone's own step never came. The bridge now sends the new update's id with its answer, and the phone stays on "Checking" until that update reports its first state. If none comes within three minutes, the phone gives the app back. The Updates card also stops showing the previous result, such as "Updated to 1.13.2.", while it waits. The update to this version still runs the old phone code, so it can show the old screen one last time. ([b6b2f246](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/b6b2f246))
- **A busy Codex pane keeps its input box on the phone.** While Codex 0.156.1 writes the first reply of a new conversation, its status row ends in a small spinner until the conversation gets its title. Collie painted that spinner over as starfield decoration, then read the row as no status row, found no input box, and showed the unread-dialog card over the working pane. A message sent in that time was refused as blocked. The spinner now counts as the end of the status row, but only as the very last mark and only after a complete status row. Found by the harness canary. ([b6b2f246](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/b6b2f246))
- **`collie update` on Windows gets through the build and the binary swap.** The build child keeps the `Path` a Windows environment carries, and the swap renames the `collie.new.exe` that Bun writes. Windows stays best effort: only the community lifecycle in `contrib/windows/` is maintained. Thanks @mqmalagris (#296, #297, #298). ([b6b2f246](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/b6b2f246))
- **The phone can update a Claude plugin marketplace.** The Marketplaces tab of Claude Code's `/plugin` screen, and the page one marketplace opens, showed only the unread-dialog card with Escape, so the phone could not press `u`. Their footers say "Enter to select", which Collie took for a question it could not read. Collie now reads both screens by their own words and shows Select, Update, Go back and the arrows, and after `u` it shows Apply changes and Cancel. Remove is never a button, on the tab or on the page, because its confirm is not a screen the phone can read. In the full-screen renderer, a marketplace page taller than the pane hides its footer, and the phone still shows no buttons there. Checked on Claude Code 2.1.283 in the classic and full-screen renderers, at 40, 82 and 120 columns. ([b6b2f246](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/b6b2f246))
- **A Muse pane with background tasks keeps its input box.** While a background task exists, Muse draws a small task list between its input box and its status line. Collie did not expect a row there, found no input box, and drew the unread-dialog card over a live pane, and an approval asked while a task ran lost its buttons the same way. Collie now reads the task list as part of Muse's own frame and leaves it off the phone, so replies, drafts and the status line work again, and an approval over one or two tasks shows its buttons. An approval over three or more tasks, or a question over any, keeps the card and its Escape, because the phone could not tie a tap to it there. While the task list has the keyboard and offers x to stop a task, the phone does not type into the pane. Checked on Muse Code 1.4.0. Thanks @jpcarranza94 (#304, #305). ([b6b2f246](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/b6b2f246))
- **History no longer shows Claude's injected text as your messages.** Claude Code marks the rows it writes itself with `isMeta`: a skill's instructions after a slash command or a Skill call, the source path of an attached image, the caveat before a local command. History showed them as your turns, and the jump between your messages stopped on each. They are now left out. A prompt Claude sends on its own, such as another session's message, a scheduled or `/loop` wake-up, or the go-on after a usage limit, stays as a System note, because the reply after it answers it. Thanks @GGGODLIN (#306). ([b6b2f246](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/b6b2f246))
- **Codex 0.157 panes keep their input box on the phone.** Codex 0.157.0 turned on its full-screen layout by default. That layout puts one more row under the status row, `? for shortcuts`, `tab to queue message`, or `← for agents · ? for shortcuts` when Codex runs through its background server. Collie expected the status row to be the last row, so it found no input box on any such pane, showed the unread-dialog card over it, and refused every send. Collie now takes that one row under the status row as part of the input box. Checked on Codex 0.157.1 with the harness canary, dialogs and a busy send included. Thanks @CorrectRoadH for the pane capture (#294). ([b6b2f246](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/b6b2f246))
- **A rewrapped row no longer leaves one word alone on its last line.** An agent writes each paragraph as one row as wide as its pane, and the phone breaks that row again at its own width, which often left a single word, such as "form.", on a line of its own. The mirror now asks the browser to balance those lines, so a word moves down to keep it company. The text itself does not change, so find, links and copy work as before, and no row gets taller. Chrome and other Chromium browsers do this on every screen. Safari 26 skips it on a screen that holds a row too wide to break, such as a rule or a table, which is most screens, and older Safari breaks lines as before. Thanks @jpcarranza94 (#302, #303). ([b6b2f246](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/b6b2f246))
- **Narrow Codex panes retain drafts without erasing typed Braille.** At 50 columns Codex 0.157.1 can truncate an unpainted status row after the context percentage. Collie now recognizes that bounded row and uses the proven particle normalization once, preserving typed Braille and keeping picker screens protected. ([b6b2f246](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/b6b2f246))
- **The clear button leaves scrolling actions fully reachable.** When X or Undo joins the pinned actions, the scrolling row reserves 16px more at its end so its last button stays clear of the pinned fade in Chromium and WebKit. ([b6b2f246](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/b6b2f246))

## [1.13.3+collie.1] - 2026-09-27

### Added

- **A ledger records the agent versions verified by each reader.** `bun run harness:drift` compares those versions with installed agents without changing their state. ([fcc3cc7d](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/fcc3cc7d))
- **A canary checks real agent screens and reply handling.** `bun run canary` exercises drafts and sends in its own Herdr session using Collie's production readers and reply guard. ([fcc3cc7d](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/fcc3cc7d))

### Fixed

- **Codex panes without an attached Herdr client show input again.** Accept the unpainted separator in their status row so an idle pane does not show the unread-dialog card (#294). ([fcc3cc7d](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/fcc3cc7d))
- **New Codex panes explain when session history becomes available.** The note says Codex reports its session after the first message, and gives hook repair steps if it stays missing (#294). ([fcc3cc7d](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/fcc3cc7d))

### Docs

- **Screen issue reports include the pane's raw ANSI output.** The bug report form and troubleshooting guide request a pane capture that preserves colors and dim text. ([fcc3cc7d](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/fcc3cc7d))

## [1.13.2+collie.1] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed

- **Codex 0.156 panes accept replies and approvals again.** Read the new status paint, wrapped drafts, trust prompt and approval options while retaining Collie's current picker and guarded action behavior. ([22c4e499](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/22c4e499))
- **Claude 2.1.283 dialogs remain readable and safe to answer.** Restore permission and question cards, pasted drafts, slash menus, custom plan paths, and startup or exit handling. ([22c4e499](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/22c4e499))

## [1.13.1+collie.12] - 2026-09-26

### Changed

- **The dashboard uses its solid bottom navigation again.** Remove the liquid glass effect and its dependency to avoid slow tab switching. ([cdff9a59](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/cdff9a59))

## [1.13.1+collie.11] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed

- **Codex's native input stays hidden in resumed panes.** Recognize the bold agents shortcut in its status footer. ([751fcf7d](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/751fcf7d))

## [1.13.1+collie.10] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed

- **Codex resume cards recognize the native progress rail.** Accept its colored count between dim rule ends while rejecting incomplete pickers. ([bf0f28d3](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/bf0f28d3))

## [1.13.1+collie.9] - 2026-09-26

### Changed

- **Dashboard glass shows more of the screen beneath it.** Reduce the floating navigation's translucent tint. ([6d51e20a](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/6d51e20a))

## [1.13.1+collie.8] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed

- **Dashboard glass reveals scrolling content behind the navigation.** Remove the opaque tab backing and the unused alternate glass mode. ([ae72b57d](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/ae72b57d))

## [1.13.1+collie.7] - 2026-09-25

### Changed

- **Dashboard navigation floats above the list with switchable glass styles.** Choose liquid-glass-react or liquid-dom in Settings; the latter uses a CSS fallback until browser backdrop capture is available. ([f9231891](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/f9231891))

## [1.13.1+collie.6] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- **Hermes history cards survive terminal resizing.** Styled panels with split titles and changing widths still fold; damaged output remains visible. ([e8f5c9ed](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/e8f5c9ed))

## [1.13.1+collie.5] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- **Hermes history cards survive wrapped terminal panels.** Resized panes restore history and startup cards instead of showing their terminal borders. ([3d012073](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/3d012073))

## [1.13.1+collie.4] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- **Hermes resume history folds repeated repaint fragments.** Split history headers and repeated earlier-message notices now join the single history card instead of cluttering the mirror. ([d842f9d9](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/d842f9d9))

## [1.13.1+collie.3] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- **Chinese action belts label compaction as compression.** The Compact control now reads 压缩 in Simplified Chinese and 壓縮 in Traditional Chinese. ([5a2d7f33](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/5a2d7f33))

## [1.13.1+collie.2] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- **The action belt leaves less empty space before Changes.** Its pinned buttons use a short fade without extra end padding. ([5861bfb2](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/5861bfb2))

## [1.13.1+collie.1] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- **Changes opens from the action belt.** Review changed files and diffs from the focused pane; the belt keeps its compact default and offers larger sizes in Settings. ([93eecc46](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/93eecc46))

### Changed

- **Updates stay visible through every machine.** Merge the upstream update mode, dashboard Focus and Changes tabs, and translated navigation while preserving Collie's existing agent controls. ([93eecc46](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/93eecc46))

### Fixed

- **Phone-started Mac updates use the new install.** Merge the upstream updater correction and keep failure details visible in the update screen. ([93eecc46](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/93eecc46))

## [1.12.1+collie.5] - 2026-09-24

### Changed

- **Codex session cards follow the current picker layout.** Remove retired resume screens and fixtures while retaining guarded selection. ([52898452](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/52898452))

## [1.12.1+collie.4] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- **Codex 0.156.1 saved sessions open as compact cards again.** Both `codex resume` and in-chat `/resume` use the existing guarded selection controls on phones. ([832ba525](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/832ba525))

## [1.12.1+collie.3] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- **The resumed-history card absorbs superseded repaint fragments.** v0.21.4 repaints the resume panel as the pane scrolls; the leftovers no longer resurface above the card, and the card keeps the announcement's session metadata. ([91ae20a2](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/91ae20a2))

### Changed

- **Codex warnings show their count beside the status icon.** The compact warning button remains tappable and keeps its full hint for hover and screen readers. ([317b4d6f](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/317b4d6f))

## [1.12.1+collie.1] - 2026-09-23

### Changed
- **A chip whose marker you deleted now says it goes in front.** Send puts such an attachment's path in front of your text. The chip now shows this before you send: its border turns dashed, its number gains an arrow, and its title and screen-reader text say where the path will go. Type the marker back to clear it (ADR 0060). ([f61a3a4e](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/f61a3a4e))
- **A pane keeps its place when its state changes.** Every list of panes now keeps the order your multiplexer shows: the pane strip inside a pane, the space view, the Switch pane sheet and a crew's dashboard. Before, a pane that blocked jumped to the top of these lists and moved back when it resumed, and in a crew a peer's blocked pane pulled that whole machine above the lead. The Switch pane sheet now groups panes by workspace like the dashboard, with one line on top that counts what needs you and takes you to the first of it. In a crew, the pane strip also stops showing another machine's panes from a tab with the same id (ADR 0063). ([bac490b4](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/bac490b4))

### Fixed
- **A block or Powerline character no longer stops short of its row.** In the terminal mirror, a prompt pill's round caps and a bar of `█` stopped a quarter of a row short, so the pill stepped in at both ends and stacked bars showed a stripe between rows. Block characters are now painted to the full row, so stacked rows meet and a half block splits at half the row. Powerline caps and arrows are painted to the same height as the pill beside them. The text, find and copy do not change. Thanks @enieuwy (#268, fixes #267). ([41483043](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/41483043), [0dbefc92](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/0dbefc92))
- **A crew update takes a member straight to the new release.** If the update to 1.12.0 left a machine behind, update the lead to 1.12.1 and tap Retry crew update on the Updates page once. A member one release behind its lead took the lead's old release the moment the update was confirmed, then refused the new one for an hour, and the Updates page said "no change for 20 minutes". The lead now hands out a turn only once it runs the new release itself. A member takes the second step of a run it already joined without waiting out its hour. And a member that is waiting on its own once-an-hour limit reads "rate-limited, retries in about N min" instead of failing. If the lead's own update rolls back, the crew run ends at once and each member's line says it was not started. No crew run stays open past 2 hours, and a new update waits until it ends (ADR 0062). ([2beed08a](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/2beed08a), [a169b75b](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/a169b75b))
- **The update band no longer runs text off the edge of a phone.** Its one line now truncates with an ellipsis instead of clipping mid-word, and every state that points at `/settings/updates` — an offer, a packaged offer, a peer that could not update — makes the whole band a single 44px-tall tap target, keyboard-reachable and named by its full sentence, with its own close staying independently tappable beside it. ([876132a1](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/876132a1))
- **The stacking primitive behind that band, the composer's status slot and every other swap between alternatives keeps its box inside the screen.** `ui/one-of.tsx`'s grid layers had no `min-w-0`, so a `white-space: nowrap` run inside one of them — the update band's own copy, on a narrow phone — could size the whole grid column to the unbroken sentence and push it off the right edge, past the point any of that copy's own truncation could still draw an ellipsis. A real-browser case now pins the geometry a unit test cannot see. ([c72125f8](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/c72125f8), [e48616e3](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/e48616e3))
- **The Switch pane sheet opens the tapped machine's own pane.** On a crew, two machines can share a pane id such as `w1:p1`; the sheet used to compare and select by that bare id alone, so both machines' rows could show as current and a tap could open the wrong machine's pane. It now compares and opens by the pane's full address, host included (ADR 0063). ([3c40b9f9](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/3c40b9f9))

## [1.12.0+collie.4] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- **Codex statusline keeps Plan and warnings concise.** Hide the duplicate Plan hint and open native warnings from a compact icon, including while Codex works. ([3d047df1](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/3d047df1))

## [1.12.0+collie.3] - 2026-09-23

### Changed

- **Codex follows Scrollback input and status rows again.** Roll back the local bare-arrow and warning-only fullscreen handling while keeping shortcut hints and guarded sends. ([62b8017c](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/62b8017c))

## [1.12.0+collie.2] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- **Codex submits replies beside its compact warning footer.** Recognize the warning-only fullscreen row after typing while preserving input verification before Enter. ([9953db5c](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/9953db5c))

## [1.12.0+collie.1] - 2026-09-23

### Changed

- **Collie adopts the upstream composer and docked dialog cards.** Merge v1.12.0 with attachment chips, multi-photo upload, floating terminal-draft notice, subpath serving and update fixes. Codex keeps native QA, Plan and Review screens; guarded sends, compact statusline and iOS viewport behavior remain. See [the full upstream changes and merge decisions](./docs/upstream-v1.12.0.md). ([435f3387](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/435f3387))

### Fixed

- **Codex fullscreen keeps its composer and statusline usable.** Recognize the shortcut hint below the native status row without binding a transcript echo as input. ([435f3387](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/435f3387))

## [1.11.1+collie.8] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- **Codex 0.156 keeps the input box hidden and the statusline live.** An empty composer is now a
  bare `›` with no placeholder text; Collie still finds that pair, strips the painted band, and
  lifts the status row — including version, project and branch — into the phone strip. ([ae00bddc](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/ae00bddc))

## [1.11.1+collie.7] - 2026-09-22

### Fixed

- **Codex keeps replies submittable when a turn finishes.** Bind Enter to the editable draft without the temporary “tab to queue message” footer, so a working-to-idle transition no longer refuses an unchanged message. Preserve that phrase when it is part of the user's text; existing draft and dialog checks still apply. ([c5d285d4](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/c5d285d4))

## [1.11.1+collie.6] - 2026-09-22

### Added

- **Cursor panes get the History button.** Collie reads Cursor Agent's own transcript
  (`~/.cursor/projects/<project>/agent-transcripts/<session>/<session>.jsonl`, or
  `COLLIE_CURSOR_ROOT`), so a Cursor pane shows the whole conversation instead of the one screen the
  terminal keeps. Needs `herdr integration install cursor`, which is what reports the session id.
  Cursor logs no tool output and no machine timestamps, so a tool call shows without its result and
  a turn shows without a time. ([74a8c431](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/74a8c431))

## [1.11.1+collie.5] - 2026-09-22

### Fixed

- **Cursor hides its input box again after the app changed colours.** Cursor now paints its input box and submitted queries in darker shades than the ones the adapter had pinned, so the box was mirrored below the transcript, the status strip stayed empty and the query rectangles disappeared. The box, the query block and the status rows are found by their full-width shape instead of a fixed palette, so a future re-skin cannot silently turn them off. ([1d3de75](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/1d3de75))

## [1.11.1+collie.4] - 2026-09-22

### Fixed

- **Cursor on-demand fees stay visible in the compact statusline.** A plan field carrying Cursor's optional `od` spend previously missed the compact grammar and fell back to the long terminal sentence; it now keeps the exact current/limit amount beside a cost icon while preserving the full field as its accessible name. ([adbed9f](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/adbed9f))

## [1.11.1+collie.3] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- **Hermes shows the model without a stale reasoning level.** Keep the full model name in the statusline, but stop appending saved session effort that can lag behind in-memory reasoning changes. ([7f5c57af](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/7f5c57af))

## [1.11.1+collie.2] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- **Recent models remember the verified model after a switch.** Sending before the next route poll records the model and reasoning level from the completed switch's local read-back. Browsing frozen history still uses the live pane model. ([c4fb263c](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/c4fb263c))

### Packaging

- **Browser tests use isolated storage across supported Node runtimes.** Disable Node's native Web Storage in Vitest workers so the existing Git checks also pass under Node 26, using jsdom's per-test-file storage instead. ([7293509f](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/7293509f))

## [1.11.1+collie.1] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- **Crew updates keep moving and leave the composer clear.** Merge upstream v1.11.1: continue polling while members update, refresh missing preflight verdicts without a watching phone, explain withheld turns in the lead journal, and move the update badge into the top notice strip. Preserve the downstream iOS viewport and verified Codex input. See [the complete upstream changes and merge decisions](./docs/upstream-v1.11.1.md). ([e4819a51](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/e4819a51))

## [1.11.0+collie.1] - 2026-09-20

### Changed

- **Follow upstream with Muse, cache insights, and reliable animated input.** Merge upstream v1.11.0, including Claude background agents and session hand-over, cache reset explanations, crew update fixes, and doctor identity handling. Combine Codex's upstream composer-band trimming with downstream verified sends; retain native QA and Plan screens. See [the complete upstream changes and merge decisions](./docs/upstream-v1.11.0.md). ([c0337366](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/c0337366))

## [1.10.2+collie.2] - 2026-09-20

### Changed

- **The Cursor statusline re-lands on this line.** The compact Cursor strip and its plan-usage fixes were cut as `1.10.1+collie.8`–`1.10.1+collie.10` on a parallel line and are folded in here, so the next release carries them together with the upstream 1.10.2 install fixes. ([49eb4cf3](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/49eb4cf3))

## [1.10.2+collie.1] - 2026-09-19

### Fixed

- **`collie update` no longer misreads a checkout, wherever it is run from.** Merge upstream 1.10.2 for three install-detection faults: a dotfiles repository at `~` made a binary install look like a source checkout and refused to update, an unreadable `.git` was read as a binary install that `update` would then move aside, and a `GIT_DIR` inherited from the shell or a git hook made every git question answer about another repository. See [the complete upstream changes and merge decisions](./docs/upstream-v1.10.2.md). ([b1c1a693](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/b1c1a693))
## [1.11.1] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- **A crew update no longer stalls after the lead has updated itself.** The phone stopped reading the update subject the moment the lead's own run reached `done`, which on a crew update is seconds in, before the members have started. That read is also what asks each member for a fresh preflight verdict, and a member whose verdict the lead does not hold is never handed its turn, so a run could sit on `waiting` for minutes and then take the release in four seconds. The phone follows the crew half of the run now, and the lead asks for the verdict it is stuck on instead of waiting to be asked. ([a0175935](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/a0175935))
- **A member that is not handed its turn now says why.** A withheld turn was the one thing an update run did in total silence, on the lead and on the member, so a run that had stopped moving looked exactly like one that was working. The lead names the machine and the cause once, in its own journal. ([a0175935](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/a0175935))
- **The update badge no longer covers the message box.** A run another device started drew a bar across the bottom of the screen, over the composer's input row, and it did so in the one case that hands that box back on purpose: after `keep using the app` on a download that had stopped. It is one line in the band above the header now, beside the connection bar and the update offer, and the band picks one winner rather than stacking them. A connection you have lost still wins that band: during a crew update the two are often one event seen twice, but not always, and hiding a machine you cannot reach is the worse of the two mistakes. ([a0175935](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/a0175935))
## [1.11.0] - 2026-09-20

### Added

- **The pane switcher now shows each row's cache time.** The Layers sheet already named the pane and its place; the same warm, expiring or cold reading that rides the dashboard row now trails the name here too, so you can tell a warm pane from a cold one without leaving the sheet. ([20d2bada](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/20d2bada))
- **Muse panes get their own adapter, so you can answer Muse from the phone.** Muse's command approval, its single-choice and multi-choice questions (with the review screen), and its workspace trust prompt show as buttons, and the command or folder they concern stays on screen above them. Collie also takes Muse's input box and status row off the mirror, shows a draft left in the box, and checks each reply against the box before it sends. A dialog quoted in the transcript, or one above a box that holds a draft, stays text, so a tap can never send a draft. Contributed by [@jpcarranza94](https://github.com/jpcarranza94) ([#244](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/pull/244)) ([d634d025](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d634d025), [c99a863d](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/c99a863d), [c7e5c8e8](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/c7e5c8e8))
- **The cache chip turns cold when an action drops the cache.** A `/model` switch to another model, an effort change, a compaction and `/reload-plugins --force` make the next turn rebuild the cached prefix, and the chip kept counting down over it. Collie now reads these actions from Claude Code's transcript as they happen, and a model change or a compaction from opencode, and shows the chip cold with the clock still running. The cache sheet names the action, or the one that most likely made the last turn miss, and the cache watch stays quiet on a pane that is already cold. Every rule carries its source, and plain `/reload-plugins`, which keeps the cache, ships as a rule too ([#236](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/issues/236)) ([da555bc8](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/da555bc8))

### Changed

- **A crew-only update takes the screen on the phone that started it.** "Retry crew update", and levelling the members while the lead is already current, left the app live with no sheet, because such a run writes no record on the lead. The phone that tapped it now gets the same sheet as a full update: the app behind is blocked until the members finish, the lead's row says it is already up to date and does not restart, and the end reads `Members updated to <version>`. A member that could not update leaves the sheet open on that phone with its reason. Every other device shows the badge, as it does for a full update. The "Still working" way out appears when no member has moved for three minutes. ([5f5c44c9](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/5f5c44c9))

### Fixed

- **Claude's background agents show on the phone again.** The list Claude draws under its statusline (`● main` and one row per agent) left the mirror with the input box, and nothing showed it anywhere. It now sits under the statusline as its own row: the first agent and a count of the rest, and a tap shows every row. Reported by [@leiyangyou](https://github.com/leiyangyou) ([#242](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/issues/242)) ([588f4694](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/588f4694))
- **Codex Astra's starfield no longer blocks sends or poses as a draft.** Astra models paint sparkles around Codex's input line. Rows of sparkles between the input line and the status row made the phone think a dialog was up, and it refused to send. Sparkles on an empty input line showed up as a stranded draft. Collie now finds the input line by its own marks and reads past the sparkles. Reported by [@dondiegorivera](https://github.com/dondiegorivera) ([#245](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/issues/245)) ([12e168cd](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/12e168cd))
- **`crew add` and `crew update` on a lead from install.sh say what to do instead of reporting a broken checkout.** Both commands push the lead's own git commit, and a standalone install has none, so both stopped with "is not a git checkout" after a full probe of the far machine. They now stop before the first ssh connection. `crew add` prints the manual path with the lead's release pinned, and `crew update` names the phone's Updates page and `collie update --to-tag` on each member. `crew add` on a packaged lead gets the same answer. Reported by [@fonnesbeck](https://github.com/fonnesbeck) ([#248](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/issues/248)) ([ad3171bf](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/ad3171bf))
- **The cache chip and History follow a Claude Code session hand-over.** Claude Code can move a live conversation into a new session file and leave a `continued-in` record at the end of the old one, while Herdr keeps naming the old session. The chip then counted down on a file nobody writes to, and History could stay on it too. Collie now follows that record to the live file, up to eight hops and never outside the projects folder it started in, and ignores it once the old session writes a new turn after it ([#236](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/issues/236)) ([1e9d1a36](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/1e9d1a36))
- **The crew update button goes away once every member runs the lead's version.** "Update crew" and "Retry crew update" could stay on the Updates page over a crew that was already level. A member that had moved past the lead counted as behind, and a member that failed a run kept counting after it updated itself. The phone and the lead now apply one rule: a member counts as behind only when its version is lower than the lead's, and a failed member stops counting once it reports the lead's version or a newer one. The band's "Could not update" line clears at the same moment. A member whose version is unknown still counts, and a member whose package manager owns it never counts, awake or asleep. ([4f4f3be5](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/4f4f3be5), [78d581bb](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/78d581bb))
- **A crew update refused over a packaged member says so.** A member whose package manager owns it cannot be levelled from the phone (ADR 0035), and a start that found only such a member behind was refused with "there is no newer release to take", which is not what happened. It now names the member and its package manager. ([24f3d37c](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/24f3d37c))
- **`collie doctor` can read its own bridge again when a tailnet login is required.** With `COLLIE_TRUSTED_USER` set and `tailscale serve` in front, the bridge refuses a read that carries no identity, so `doctor` could not reach its own `/api/snapshot` and called a healthy bridge one that was down. It now shows the login it is configured with, and a refusal that still comes back is reported as a refusal, not as a bridge to go and start. Reported by [@ubuntudroid](https://github.com/ubuntudroid) ([#238](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/issues/238)) ([a94d41a0](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/a94d41a0), [1ae0dde2](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/1ae0dde2))
- **The close button on a failed update sheet closes it.** A failed update leaves its sheet open with the reason, and the sheet offered a close that did nothing, so it covered the app until the page reloaded. The close now puts it away on that device, and a later failure shows again. ([5f5c44c9](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/5f5c44c9))

## [1.10.2] - 2026-09-19

### Fixed

- **`collie update` works again when your home directory is a git repository.** A dotfiles repository whose working tree sits at `~` made Collie read a binary install as a source checkout. `collie update` then refused to run and pointed you at your own dotfiles remote. Collie now counts a directory as a checkout only when the repository starts there. Reported by [@krishkumar](https://github.com/krishkumar) ([#243](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/issues/243)) ([d43f8fd1](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d43f8fd1))
- **A checkout whose git data is unreadable is never mistaken for a binary install.** A corrupt or unreadable `.git` made git refuse to answer, and Collie then read the folder as a binary install, which `collie update` moves aside. Collie now stops, says the git data cannot be read, and tells you to repair it. ([0091f5ec](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/0091f5ec))
- **Collie no longer asks git about the wrong repository.** If `GIT_DIR` or one of its siblings was set in your shell, or Collie ran from a git hook, every git question it asked was answered about that other repository instead of its own. No Collie process passes those variables to anything it starts now. ([ADR 0049](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/blob/main/.adr/0049-no-child-inherits-a-relocated-repository.md), [dcd313b1](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/dcd313b1))
## [1.10.1+collie.10] - 2026-09-20

### Changed

- **Cursor plan usage separates its labels from the numbers.** `AUTO6%` ran the label into its value, and in a terminal face whose zero carries no slash that reads as `AUT06%`; a colon now sits between each label and its share. ([12094d8](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/12094d8))

## [1.10.1+collie.9] - 2026-09-20

### Changed

- **Cursor plan usage spells out AUTO instead of A.** The compact strip abbreviated Cursor's `auto` share to a single letter next to `API`, which read as an unrelated code; both shares now carry the word the terminal prints. ([a465abd](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/a465abd))

## [1.10.1+collie.8] - 2026-09-20

### Changed

- **Cursor status stays compact while tasks are running.** Its separate task and metrics rows now share one horizontally scrolling strip, with accessible icons for activity, model, workspace, context and plan usage; active tasks animate without overriding reduced-motion preferences, and unknown fields keep their original ANSI text. ([dbff0ed](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/dbff0ed))

## [1.10.1+collie.7] - 2026-09-19

### Fixed

- **A statusline no longer blinks out while a reply streams.** The agent's TUI repaints its footer many times a second, and a poll that lands mid-repaint reads a screen with no footer in it at all — measured on a streaming Hermes pane, 2 of 320 samples at ~100 ms — so the strip unmounted for that poll and the whole chrome below it moved up and back. The strip now holds the last rows that really carried one for up to five seconds, keyed on the pane and its agent so a pane switch or an exited agent never inherits them. ([1f61867a](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/1f61867a))

## [1.10.1+collie.6] - 2026-09-19

### Fixed

- **A hint-shaped notification no longer hides the composer.** Claude paints its notifications right-aligned on a row of its own below the mode row, and `Ctrl+Y to paste deleted text` reads as `<key> to <verb>`, which is the shape of a dialog footer — so it refused the input box outright while it was up: the status strip went empty and the composer was greyed, because `hasInputBox` is the send gate. A row Claude right-aligns is now read as an aside and is exempt from that check, and the tip pill is driven by that same rule rather than by one known sentence, so a notification this app has never seen lands behind the lightbulb instead of in the strip. Pinned by `claude--notification-paste-delete.txt`, a capture of that screen. ([361295c2](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/361295c2))

## [1.10.1+collie.5] - 2026-09-19

### Added

- **Claude's new-task tip becomes an icon on the actions belt.** Claude Code paints `new task? /clear to save N tokens` under its statusline — appended to the statusline row, or alone on a right-aligned row of its own — and the strip printed it as raw text between compact status fields. It is a suggestion carrying a command, not a status field, so it is now an icon-only pill at the end of Collie's run on the actions belt, which opens the dock with the sentence verbatim; it appears and disappears with the pane's own tip, and no other pane grows a pill. The strip drops the sentence rather than showing it twice. ([22e9be98](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/22e9be98))

## [1.10.1+collie.4] - 2026-09-19

### Fixed

- **A multi-line Claude reply sends again.** Claude Code 2.1.278 paints its `ctrl+g to edit in Vim` hint on the statusline row while the input box holds a multi-line draft; read as a plan-dialog footer, that row hid the composer from the send guard, which then typed the text and withheld Enter — the phone reported "text delivered, not submitted" on every multi-line send. The plan family now requires that phrase to OPEN the row, which every real ExitPlanMode footer does, so the dialog stays refused and a user-configured statusline that ends its row with the hint no longer counts as one. Pinned by `claude--draft-multiline-vim-hint.txt`. ([7332a2eb](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/7332a2eb))
- **Claude's new-task hint stops printing in the status strip.** A newer Claude Code paints its `new task? /clear to save N tokens` notification right-aligned on its own row below the mode row, and a row without pipe-separated fields fell through to the verbatim branch, so the phone showed the hint as a raw, indented strip row. It now reaches the same read-only Info button the same-row placement uses, and unknown notification text is unchanged. ([7332a2eb](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/7332a2eb))

## [1.10.1+collie.3] - 2026-09-19

### Fixed

- **Keep a Hermes diff a full rectangle across the pane's wrapped lines.** A long diff line re-wraps at the pane width into column-0 continuations that lose their +/- gutter or leading space, and the first such row ended the whole hunk: every later row kept Hermes's raw bright fill, ragged at the text edge. The hunk now continues across rows still wearing its paint — wrapped changed rows join the rectangle, wrapped context rows stay undecorated — and ends only at a row wearing neither. ([2cf4bf1c](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/2cf4bf1c))

## [1.10.1+collie.2] - 2026-09-18

### Added

- **Cursor Agent gains a purpose-built mobile terminal view.** Submitted queries and diffs render as full-width rectangles, live input chrome moves out of the mirror, its status stays fixed above Composer, and the Agent palette plus Model, Summarize and Resume shortcuts use Cursor's documented commands. ([3e76008](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/3e76008))

## [1.10.1+collie.1] - 2026-09-17

### Fixed

- **Claude input follows upstream frame detection and modal guards.** Merge upstream 1.10.1 for clipped slash-command names, safer background-agent and history-search screens, and unbroken dashboard counts. Preserve downstream Composer, statusline, display and input protections. See [the complete upstream changes and merge decisions](./docs/upstream-v1.10.1.md). ([5eae453b](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/5eae453b))

## [1.10.1] - 2026-09-17

### Fixed

- **The dashboard summary no longer splits a count across two lines.** On a phone with all five states, each count stays in one piece, and whole counts move to a second line when the row is too wide. ([45084e9e](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/45084e9e))
- **A send no longer stalls when Claude's slash menu cuts a command name.** On a narrow pane Claude shortens a long command name with a leading `…`, and Collie then lost sight of the input box, typed the text and held back Enter, so the message needed a second send. Collie now finds the input box by its own frame and reads the shortened names; rows under the box that it cannot name stay visible on the mirror. Names cut onto a hyphen and names that print an alias in brackets are read too. ([67387a7e](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/67387a7e), [56f2846b](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/56f2846b))
- **A send can no longer land on Claude's background-agents screen.** That screen has a typing field of its own, and Collie read it as the ordinary message box: a send from the phone pressed Enter there and started an agent task. Collie now recognises the screen and holds the send until you leave it. ([67387a7e](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/67387a7e), [56f2846b](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/56f2846b))

## [1.10.0+collie.11] - 2026-09-17

### Fixed

- **Hermes startup cards and fixed status survive the latest CLI.** Recognize both Hermes emblems and the new MCP server count, preserve rounded response borders as single full-width lines, and keep the complete model and reasoning level in the fixed status bar. ([201c4f91](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/201c4f91))

## [1.10.0+collie.10] - 2026-09-17

### Fixed

- **Codex resume cards handle identical and truncated session titles.** Bind each visible session to its native list position, keep row identities stable while browsing, and accept native search hint changes without weakening write guards or affecting other agents. ([0c6aeb14](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/0c6aeb14))

## [1.10.0+collie.9] - 2026-09-17

### Changed

- **Codex simple dialogs stay in their native terminal view.** Retire QA, plan, review, and folder-trust cards and their custom automation, restore the base QA parser to upstream, and keep model, session, approval, and statusline cards with guarded chat input. ([b153074b](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/b153074b))

## [1.10.0+collie.8] - 2026-09-17

### Fixed

- **Codex Plan and Fast work before resumed session hooks run.** Keep native composer and idle-state checks active when a session ID is not yet reported, abort if that identity appears or changes mid-switch, and keep recent model history tied to a real session. ([bdeb8b64](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/bdeb8b64))

## [1.10.0+collie.7] - 2026-09-17

### Fixed

- **Codex plan cards include the conversation recap after resuming.** Keep the plan and its collapsible recap separate, preserve long-plan recovery and native implementation choices, and reject stale actions when the recap changes. ([4d9ccf65](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/4d9ccf65))

## [1.10.0+collie.6] - 2026-09-17

### Changed

- **Claude statuslines show Fast and cache data more clearly.** A reusable formatter reads the actual Fast flag and native cache warmth and hit ratio, preserving missing-data states. The fixed bar uses hollow/filled lightning icons, compact cache fields, a tappable native hint, and matching left alignment for its mode row. ([f5d1d04e](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/f5d1d04e))

## [1.10.0+collie.5] - 2026-09-17

### Changed

- **Claude custom statuslines use compact fields in the fixed bar.** Pipe-separated model, effort, branch, and version fields retain their text and gain compact spacing and icons; ctx uses the remaining-context ring and capacity colors shared with Codex. Native right-side hints no longer carry terminal-width blank padding, and the existing Claude mode row and other agents keep their behavior. ([f6931162](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/f6931162))

## [1.10.0+collie.4] - 2026-09-16

### Fixed

- **Claude Settings tabs consistently retain their native display.** Status, Config, Usage, and Stats no longer alternate between raw output and generic menu cards. The exclusion is scoped to Claude's detector, preserves composer input protection, and leaves model pickers and other agents' cards unchanged. ([45eaa060](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/45eaa060))

## [1.10.0+collie.3] - 2026-09-16

### Changed

- **Agent cards share a frame with optional content slots.** The existing prompt panel now owns reusable header, action, and footer layout while each card retains its native content and interaction rules. ([45047d0b](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/45047d0b))
- **Codex status-line settings use a quieter, compact list.** Thin separators replace repeated selected borders, only the focused item exposes reorder controls, and keyboard help folds away. Codex model, question, review, session, and command-approval cards share header and action layout while preserving their specialized content and native submission behavior. ([55efcd80](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/55efcd80))

## [1.10.0+collie.2] - 2026-09-16

### Added
- **Codex shows its native first-token time in the statusline.** A compact timer displays the latest completed turn's reported timing from the active session journal. It refreshes even when terminal text is unchanged, remains absent when timing is unavailable, and leaves other agents untouched. ([49987a6d](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/49987a6d))

### Fixed
- **Codex keeps its statusline picker card when the list scrolls.** Selecting model can scroll the theme option away while its separator remains visible. Recognize that leading separator without relaxing the complete-dialog, painted-selection, or unknown-row guards. ([2860e360](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/2860e360))

## [1.10.0+collie.1] - 2026-09-16

### Changed
- **Merge upstream 1.10.0 while preserving downstream controls and cards.** Adopt stable dashboard ordering, workspace filters, clearer unseen and blocked indicators, operator-chosen tab names, shared Herdr state resolution, isolated Bun builds, and Muse display fixes. Keep downstream Composer, input protections, agent cards, font settings, and disabled workflows. See [the complete upstream changes and merge decisions](./docs/upstream-v1.10.0.md). ([d2fe80a4](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/d2fe80a4))

## [1.10.0] - 2026-09-16

### Changed

- **The dashboard keeps every pane where it sits.** Panes stay in their workspace group in the multiplexer's own order, whatever their status, and the Needs you and Ready · unseen sections at the top are gone. What needs you now shows where the pane sits: a red wash on its row, a red dot on its workspace heading, and one summary line at the top that counts every state in words, which a tap takes you to. Each heading shows the same counts as numbers. ([a039e277](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/a039e277))
- **A strip of workspace chips filters the dashboard.** Tap a workspace to see it alone, tap it or All to see everything. Long-press a chip to hide that workspace, and long-press it again to bring it back; a hidden chip stays in the strip, dimmed and struck through, still showing its status. The choice is kept on each device, by workspace name. ([a039e277](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/a039e277))
- **An unseen reply is marked with a square.** A finished pane you have not opened carries a small square after its name, on the summary line, on its workspace heading and on its chip, instead of a white dot and a green wash that read as one more status. ([a039e277](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/a039e277))
- **A tab you named that holds one pane names that pane.** If you named a tab and it holds a single pane, the header, the belt, the dashboard and push notifications now use that tab name ahead of the title Claude writes itself, which moves to the dashboard row's second line. A `/rename` and a pane label still come first, and a tmux window keeps its automatic name out of it. ([8962e695](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/8962e695))
- **The switcher mark shows a red dot when another pane needs you.** While you are in one pane, the layers icon at the end of the bottom belt carries a red dot as soon as any other pane is waiting on you, and its spoken name says so. Only a pane that needs you lights it. ([eb7470d1](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/eb7470d1))
- **The tab belt names the pane and underlines the open tab.** A tab that holds one pane shows that pane's name, so the open tab and the header read the same word. The open tab is underlined, every other tab reads in near full ink, and the brand tile and the dashed desktop-focus ring are gone from the cells. ([a039e277](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/a039e277))

### Fixed

- **A Herdr plugin action reads the same state as the running service.** Herdr puts its own plugin state directory into every action it runs, and Collie used it, so the `push-test` action found no subscriptions and an update started from the `update` or `update-major` action kept its progress record where the phone could not see it. Collie now ignores that directory; `COLLIE_STATE_DIR` still moves the state. Thanks @lighcen (#226). ([d07ec4c4](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d07ec4c4))
- **An update that finds its target already live stages nothing and records nothing.** Such a run used to leave its update record at `staging`, and the phone reported an interrupted update about an install that was fine; it now ends before the record opens and before it asks for Bun. Thanks @foreverrrree (#231). ([a18827d5](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/a18827d5))
- **A Muse pane's hard line breaks read as soft wraps on the phone.** The 2-column row gutter and the full-width row padding Muse draws are trimmed from its native mirror, so paragraphs no longer show a stray indent or blank stub lines. Detectors still read the untrimmed screen. Thanks @jpcarranza94 (#230). ([d67f48b5](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d67f48b5))
- **A Muse pane's light mirror stands on Herdr's own light background.** The native ground moves from the page grey to `#fffbf8`, so Muse's prompt fill and other authored tones keep their contrast. Thanks @jpcarranza94 (#229). ([cc76e9bf](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/cc76e9bf))
- **An update checks Bun can run before it touches the checkout.** A managed or staged update now asks `bun --version` first and stops with the checkout unchanged when Bun cannot answer. A machine whose Bun is installed but cannot run now refuses its update instead of warning: the update check shows red rather than amber, which also blocks a crew update until that Bun is fixed. The compile step runs in a private folder under `bin/`, so Bun's scratch file no longer lands in the checkout root; `bin/` must be a real directory, not a symlink. Thanks @en-ver (#232). ([53e2f462](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/53e2f462))

## [1.9.1+collie.13] - 2026-09-16

### Fixed
- **Keep Hermes session cards consistent with the chosen typeface.** Startup and history card headings and summaries follow the interface font setting instead of forcing Aldrich; agent-authored body text keeps its existing content font. ([e6970f2a](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/e6970f2a))

## [1.9.1+collie.12] - 2026-09-16

### Changed

- **Reformat Hermes session cards around their meaningful content.** Startup cards extract model, provider, directory, build and session details into labeled facts, with readable tool, MCP and skill groups. Restored history separates speakers and renders assistant Markdown; decorative terminal art, frames and welcome boilerplate leave the reading view, while useful tips, source-row accounting and search are preserved. ([284bbca0](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/284bbca0))

## [1.9.1+collie.11] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- **Keep Hermes startup details in a compact information card.** The native banner, launch command and welcome tips fold into a separate startup card with version and tool/skill counts. Restored-session names and user-message counts move into the history card, while full details remain expandable and searchable. Unknown or incomplete output stays visible. ([3e58dcd9](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/3e58dcd9))

## [1.9.1+collie.10] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- **Fold Hermes resume history into a readable conversation card.** Complete native Previous Conversation panels start collapsed and expand into a bounded scrolling region, preserving role colors, blank lines and searchable text without sending input. Incomplete panels and raw terminal mode keep their original display. ([316da253](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/316da253))

## [1.9.1+collie.9] - 2026-09-16

### Fixed

- **Show every Codex preset in the Agent command panel.** Plan, Fast, and the remaining built-in commands are available by scrolling without a search, while preserving the three-row panel, argument entry, and confirmation for destructive commands. Other agents keep their existing default lists. ([c9ea9e6a](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/c9ea9e6a))

## [1.9.1+collie.8] - 2026-09-16

### Fixed

- **Claude diff rows paint one stable rectangle.** Every changed row's own fill is promoted to the full-row surface, whatever character follows the `+`/`-` sign and across Claude's own wrapped continuations, so a diff no longer renders as a ragged mix of raw and surfaced rows on the phone. ([97a4b36](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/97a4b36))

## [1.9.1+collie.7] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- **Give Hermes panes the Agent palette and the harness shortcut bar.** The Agent button had been withdrawn from Hermes panes because no catalog was filed for the agent; it now lists 39 commands curated from the Hermes CLI source's own command registry — including its queue, steer and background-session verbs — with the destructive ones (/clear, /new, /undo, /stop, /quit) confirming first. The shortcut bar above the keys gains Model, Compact and Resume, sending the registry's canonical spellings. The Quick dock already served Hermes the shared localized replies and is unchanged. ([e306d1fa](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/e306d1fa))

## [1.9.1+collie.6] - 2026-09-16

### Changed

- **The composer keys sit on plain chrome and the reply field reads a frame.** The keys belt drops
  its gray fill and brand tint, matching the rest of the composer, and the reply box's border takes
  the one-step-deeper rule colour. ([bb254844](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/bb254844))

## [1.9.1+collie.5] - 2026-09-16

### Changed

- **The session card's Cancel moves right and becomes visible.** Browse arrows sit on the row's left
  and Cancel takes the right as a bordered, full-size button instead of a small ghost one. ([54410e21](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/54410e21))

## [1.9.1+collie.4] - 2026-09-16

### Changed

- **Saved sessions use a compact, localized picker card.** Keep native session titles and guarded actions intact while presenting a bounded list with two-line titles, inline selection, localized ages, bottom search, and collapsible keyboard help. Resume and fork retain distinct labels and all existing native controls. ([5852a79d](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/5852a79d))

## [1.9.1+collie.3] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- **Codex's saved-session picker is a card.** `/resume` opens as a list of your recorded sessions —
  title, age and branch — with the native search field, Up/Down browse and one confirming Enter; the
  `tab` toolbar, archive, density and transcript keys stay untouched and a row expanded with `ctrl+e`
  keeps its native rendering. ([59d051f7](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/59d051f7))

## [1.9.1+collie.2] - 2026-09-15

### Added

- **Codex asynchronous questions open directly as touch-friendly answer cards.** Pending questions retain a compact entry while the ordinary composer stays available. Open, browse unanswered questions, choose an option or submit a custom multiline answer through verified native controls; existing blocking questionnaires keep their separate behavior. ([7ae8630e](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/7ae8630e))

## [1.9.1+collie.1] - 2026-09-15

### Changed

- **Merge upstream 1.9.1 with operator-selected Composer and Codex behavior.** Adopt the upstream 40px tinted actions belt and right fade while retaining keys inside Input without autofocus. Preserve full-row Codex user/diff rectangles with upstream luminance-based fill detection. Include urgent update notices, Herdr idle completions, Muse light rendering, installation docs, and WebKit checks; keep workflows disabled. See [complete upstream changes and integration decisions](./docs/upstream-v1.9.1.md). ([79d24064](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/79d24064))

## [1.9.0+collie.6] - 2026-09-15

### Changed

- **The Input control includes the direct terminal key rail.** Merge the separate Keys launcher into Input and restore the horizontal navigation/function-key accessory between the action belt and textarea, without autofocus or opening the phone keyboard. Preserve immediate ordered key delivery, one-shot/locked modifiers, hold-repeat, draft protection, and pane/lock cleanup on the current composer surface. Preserve textarea focus on mousedown so cancelling pointerdown does not swallow WebKit touch clicks. ([3ad426e7](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/3ad426e7))

## [1.9.0+collie.5] - 2026-09-15

### Fixed

- **Statusline text stays intact on a unified composer surface.** Move vertical breathing room inside the statusline scroller so terminal fonts are not clipped while keeping a single row's overall height. Use the composer's chrome colour across the action belt and harness commands, remove its right fade, and place the pane switcher beside the scroller so every action can scroll fully into view. ([90e7c7d7](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/90e7c7d7))

## [1.9.0+collie.4] - 2026-09-15

### Fixed

- **Recognize Hermes's busy-command and password screens.** The prompt's leading icon changes with the state — a spinner during `/compact`, 🔑 at a password prompt, plus approval, sudo and voice — and any unknown icon rejected the whole footer, stranding the statusline (wrapped, with its title on its own row) and the italic instruction in the mirror. The prompt now accepts the source's closed state-icon set with an optional profile prefix, and those states' italic instructions are lifted into the fixed strip instead of vanishing with the composer. ([d447f4d8](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/d447f4d8))

## [1.9.0+collie.3] - 2026-09-15

### Changed

- **The mode row's cycle hint reads as terminal text.** Draw Claude's `shift+tab` hint as `(⇧⇥)` in the statusline's own font instead of two keyboard icons, matching the arrows the terminal paints beside it. ([4fa9e6e3](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/4fa9e6e3))

### Fixed

- **Composer fades preserve labels and empty status controls disappear.** Narrow the pinned pane switcher's fade to 16px so neighbouring action labels remain legible. Show Codex Plan/Fast controls only with an actual statusline, while preserving a standalone multi-host send target. ([c00c92f9](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/c00c92f9))

## [1.9.0+collie.1] - 2026-09-15

### Changed

- **Merge upstream 1.9.0 and prefer its overlapping implementations.** Adopt upstream cache monitoring, configuration files, update progress, actions belt, pane naming, and wrapped-URL fixes; reconcile question cards and retain unique downstream mode/model controls, safe-area layout, fonts, and agent display fixes. See [complete upstream changes and integration decisions](./docs/upstream-v1.9.0.md). ([16e2a4c7](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/16e2a4c7))

## [1.8.2+collie.22] - 2026-09-15

### Fixed

- **Draw Claude's sent message as one full grey rectangle.** The echo is painted row by row in the terminal's own fill, so each row's grey ended where its padding ran out and the shades differed. The rows now join Codex's echoes on the shared full-row user surface: one rectangle across the row, one grey, on both themes. ([6a3f1c22](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/6a3f1c22))

## [1.8.2+collie.21] - 2026-09-14

### Added

- **Tap Claude's statusline mode to cycle it.** The permission mode on the statusline row becomes a button that sends the terminal's own `shift+tab` and confirms the mode text moved; the `(shift+tab to cycle)` prose is replaced by the two keys it names, drawn with the composer keyboard's own Shift and Tab icons. It stays tappable while Claude works — an unmoved mode reports "sent, unconfirmed" — and disappears while a permission dialog owns the keyboard, because that dialog itself answers on `shift+tab`. ([df97c8a4](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/df97c8a4))

## [1.8.2+collie.20] - 2026-09-14

### Fixed

- **Keep a Hermes frame in the terminal's own colour.** A border is a row of nothing but rule glyphs, so the parser marked it decorative chrome and repainted it neutral: a message read gold along the top and grey along the bottom, and a wrapped frame turned grey halfway along. A fitted frame is now kept in the skin's ink. ([c03379ce](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/c03379ce))

## [1.8.2+collie.19] - 2026-09-14

### Fixed

- **Fit Hermes response frames the pane cut in two.** A frame drawn while the window was wider is re-wrapped by the pane, so its border arrives split across two rows and no longer matched: the frame stayed raw and left a `────╮` at the start of a message and a `────╯` at the end. The border is rejoined on its label's row and fitted, including one whose opening has scrolled off; the row it was cut over becomes blank rather than disappearing, so message rows keep lining up with the screen. ([1e73ca8f](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/1e73ca8f))

## [1.8.2+collie.18] - 2026-09-14

### Changed

- **Add compact branch and version icons to Codex statuslines.** Prefix conventional or explicitly labelled branches with a Git branch icon and version numbers with a tag icon, preserving their full text, terminal colors, and the existing row height. Leave unrecognized fields and absolute paths unchanged. ([fc4cc60b](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/fc4cc60b))

## [1.8.2+collie.17] - 2026-09-14

### Changed

- **Keep Codex model, Plan, and Fast controls in one statusline.** Replace the separate Plan strip with compact Plan and Fast buttons immediately after the model and thinking level, separated by quiet vertical rules. Keep multi-host targets first and other native fields in their original order, remove duplicate native mode hints, and scroll the single row horizontally on narrow screens. Both controls distinguish on, off, unknown, and busy states without changing size, and share the model switcher's disabled and session protections. Fast sends one guarded native `/fast` command and confirms the resulting status before showing success; it never retries an uncertain toggle or accepts a native confirmation automatically. ([5a4b8d65](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/5a4b8d65))

## [1.8.2+collie.16] - 2026-09-14

### Added

- **Keep Codex Plan mode visible with a guarded toggle.** A permanent control above the statusline distinguishes enabled, disabled, unknown, and switching states with icons and color. Switch once through Codex's native Shift+Tab binding, protect the current session and terminal draft, and confirm the result from the live composer footer; retain the last verified mode while busy and remove its duplicate native hint from the compact statusline. ([2189ee03](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/2189ee03))

### Changed

- **Disable Plan and model controls when switching is unavailable.** Keep both entries visible but inactive while Codex is working, a dialog or terminal draft owns input, direct typing or sending is active, the connection is unavailable, or another switch is running. Existing app drafts remain mounted, and all seven UI languages include mode labels and failure messages. ([2189ee03](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/2189ee03))

## [1.8.2+collie.15] - 2026-09-14

### Changed

- **Model switching uses a lighter frosted glass overlay.** Reduce the picker blur and tint by half and add a faint inset highlight, keeping model names and the selected row easier to recognize while automatic switching blocks manual input. ([717f430f](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/717f430f))

## [1.8.2+collie.14] - 2026-09-14

### Fixed

- **Automatic model switching masks only the active picker card.** Add a soft translucent blur while keeping the transcript clear and scrollable. Reserve a separate single-line progress row for the spinner, current step, target model and effort, and Stop action so it never overlaps the picker footer; long progress text scrolls horizontally on narrow phones. ([290c2c05](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/290c2c05))

## [1.8.2+collie.13] - 2026-09-14

### Changed

- **Clarify automated model switching with a quieter progress strip.** Keep the model and reasoning cards behind a lighter translucent interaction mask, with an opaque two-line progress strip flush above the statusline. Show the current step and target without duplicate headings or underlying text bleeding through; retain the Stop action, respect the selected UI and terminal fonts, and keep picker descriptions at normal weight. ([7c22a1d2](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/7c22a1d2))

## [1.8.2+collie.12] - 2026-09-14

### Changed

- **Recent Codex models follow their session and show switching progress.** The recent list is now scoped to the actual Codex session on this device, preserving resume history without sharing pairs across sessions; legacy global history is retained without guessing its owner. Automatic switching displays the native model and reasoning pickers in sequence beneath a translucent interaction-blocking mask with a Stop action, and uses a chevron for expansion. Split model/effort statuslines verify correctly, session changes stop the flow, unavailable targets remain explicit errors without fallback, and Plan/global scope choices are left for the operator in the native card. ([c11effa0](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/c11effa0))

## [1.8.2+collie.11] - 2026-09-14

### Changed

- **Share the existing Composer panel container.** Quick actions, agent commands and display settings reuse one UI primitive so additional Composer panels inherit the same visual style. ([c7665c63](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/c7665c63))
- **Integrate recent models into the Composer panel layout.** Open a compact, full-width list above the statusline without covering it or moving the reply input. Align model names and thinking levels on one row, show up to three rows before scrolling, and reveal removal and two-tap clearing only in Manage. Keep other Composer docks mutually exclusive and separate the model from task status with a subtle gray rule after removing inherited button padding. ([99223c35](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/99223c35))

## [1.8.2+collie.10] - 2026-09-14

### Added

- **Keep Codex approval details beside the decision buttons.** Show the execution environment, reason and full command in one card, with expandable long commands and read-only persistent permission choices. ([87421032](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/87421032))
- **Edit Codex question notes without leaving the question card.** Preserve local drafts across question navigation and submit native notes or custom answers with verified paste and a single confirmation; Chinese text and blank lines remain intact. ([87421032](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/87421032))
- **Choose Codex review scopes from native picker cards.** Present review presets, base branches and commits using the existing model picker layout and guarded native navigation. Custom review instruction editors keep their terminal presentation. ([87421032](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/87421032))

## [1.8.2+collie.9] - 2026-09-13

### Changed

- **Make recent model choices easier to reach.** Keep the native Codex picker available with empty history, prevent cross-tab storage write-back, and clarify recent model rows with two-line hierarchy and separated actions. ([33040362](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/33040362))

## [1.8.2+collie.8] - 2026-09-13

### Changed
- **Codex model presets give way to a recently-used list.** The statusline's model opens a small menu above the field instead of a bottom sheet, listing the model and thinking-level pairs this device has actually sent a reply with, most recent first. Each entry can be removed and the whole history cleared with a two-tap confirm; the hand-edited editor and its Settings card are gone. An up arrow after the model marks the field when something in the list is not what is on screen. ([77d940b9](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/77d940b9))
- **Thinking levels use Codex's own English names, and only the levels it really offers.** The picker now reads Low, Medium, High, Extra high, Max and Ultra — the six rows Codex 0.154 draws — instead of translated labels for levels such as `none` and `minimal` that its selection menu never serves. ([77d940b9](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/77d940b9))

## [1.8.2+collie.7] - 2026-09-13

### Fixed
- **Stop the preset sheet calling a running switch blocked.** While a switch is in flight the status box prints "Switching…" alone instead of appending the reason it refuses a *new* switch — during Codex's own picker that reason reads "Switching is unavailable", so a switch that was plainly under way appeared both running and refused. ([55910e37](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/55910e37))

## [1.8.2+collie.6] - 2026-09-13

### Added
- **Switch Codex model and reasoning with editable device presets.** Open presets from the statusline model, manage model/effort pairs on this device, and switch through verified native menus while Codex is idle. Preserve Composer drafts and attachments, cancel remaining steps when the panel closes, and keep native selection available when a preset cannot be applied. Apply both the global default and Plan override when Codex asks for scope, and recognize animated Plan input with advanced reasoning's colored prompt. ([2cd9021f](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/2cd9021f))

## [1.8.2+collie.5] - 2026-09-13

### Fixed
- **Restore consistent muted titles across Composer panels.** Quick, Agent and Display titles use the original shared gray tone in both themes while retaining the larger bold typography and current dock layout. ([31d9fbc3](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/31d9fbc3))

## [1.8.2+collie.4] - 2026-09-13

### Changed

- **Agent commands share the compact Composer dock.** Replace the command sheet with the same inline panel as Quick and Display, keep three command rows above a fixed bottom search field, and enlarge all three dock titles. Preserve full-catalog search, operator commands, direct submission, argument insertion and destructive-command confirmation. ([454770e4](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/454770e4))

## [1.8.2+collie.3] - 2026-09-13

### Fixed

- **Render Markdown in every Codex plan card body.** Format headings, lists, emphasis and fenced code in the visible terminal plan even when no matching journal entry is available; preserve verified full-plan recovery, partial-plan notices and the bounded reading area. ([47df931c](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/47df931c))

## [1.8.2+collie.2] - 2026-09-13

### Changed

- **Localize built-in Composer quick replies.** Quick buttons and their sent text now follow the selected language while shell and operator-defined replies remain unchanged. ([eb6bedc4](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/eb6bedc4))

## [1.8.2+collie.1] - 2026-09-13

### Changed

- **Upstream 1.8.2 improves mobile chrome and reliable PWA updates.** Adopt the upstream shared strip band, active-tab reveal, navigation transitions, OMP rendering, channel icons, static compression and service-worker update flow. Preserve downstream direct input, bottom safe-area coverage, statusline and Codex cards; see the complete Chinese reconciliation in `docs/upstream-v1.8.2.md`. ([9a30f1e1](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/9a30f1e1))

## [1.8.0+collie.16] - 2026-09-13

### Added

- **Codex plans become readable cards with separate decision controls.** Keep long plan bodies in a collapsible scrolling region above the native implementation choices. Match the visible plan against its journal source before displaying complete Markdown; otherwise retain the visible terminal text and identify clipped plans explicitly. Preserve all three native decisions, including fresh-context implementation, with the existing guarded pointer-and-confirm flow; a different plan after confirmation is not success evidence. Prevent Claude and Antigravity from misreading this Codex menu as their own folder-trust prompt. ([358faf6c](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/358faf6c))

## [1.8.0+collie.15] - 2026-09-13

### Changed

- **Codex question cards keep progress and answers together.** Show the question number, unanswered count and full question inside the option card. Previous/next controls restore each question's native selection; selecting an option no longer submits it immediately. Confirm each answer explicitly, then submit the complete set only after the other questions are answered. Edited answers become pending again. ([776b4b8c](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/776b4b8c))

## [1.8.0+collie.14] - 2026-09-13

### Added

- **Codex model and statusline menus become native option cards.** Open either picker directly from Agent commands; choose models and reasoning levels, search and toggle statusline items, move them one position at a time, and keep the terminal's preview and save/cancel behavior. Every action verifies the current picker and its target before sending keys. Saving a single-item or disabled statusline keeps subsequent composer input available. ([af6b6514](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/af6b6514))

## [1.8.0+collie.13] - 2026-09-13

### Fixed

- **Codex command shortcuts submit without an extra Enter tap.** Recognize the exact slash-command input above Codex's completion list, which replaces its normal statusline, and verify that it matches the selected completion. Commands marked with the return icon now finish the existing verified input-and-submit flow; retain prompt binding and modal checks, argument-taking shortcuts, and other agents' behavior. ([953892bb](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/953892bb))

## [1.8.0+collie.12] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- **Codex waits for the input tail before requesting submission.** Keep polling when a paste has only painted a prefix or middle fragment, preventing premature Enter requests that fail with “screen changed before send.” Accept the visible tail of long, scrolled drafts, apply the same check to image captions, and preserve exact prompt binding, image-count checks and other agents' existing matching behavior without retyping or retrying a refused submission. ([6561c8ea](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/6561c8ea))

## [1.8.0+collie.11] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- **Claude diffs form continuous rectangles with equal side gutters.** Extend painted numbered change rows across the mirror using the shared diff surface, closing gaps between adjacent rows while preserving Claude's colors, inline highlights, original text and wrapping. Dialog controls and raw terminal mode retain their existing behavior. ([9b73d895](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/9b73d895))

## [1.8.0+collie.10] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- **Codex 0.154 animated input stays readable and reliably sends.** Recognize the live composer's painted Braille particles as decorated spaces, remove its padding from the transcript, and stop mistaking its empty placeholder for a terminal draft. Reuse the same conservative normalization when verifying bound input so animation frames cannot cause false prompt-changed errors; preserve real punctuation, Braille, image markers, paths and raw terminal output. ([ed9c0413](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/ed9c0413))

## [1.8.0+collie.9] - 2026-09-11

### Changed

- **Codex returns to a single native statusline row.** Remove the separate interrupt/queue operation-hint strip and restore the original Working indicator in the terminal transcript. Revert the display-only changes from collie.7; Hermes hints and guarded input remain unchanged. ([995a2d07](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/995a2d07))

## [1.8.0+collie.8] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- **Hermes clarify choices become native phone option cards.** Single-choice and batch questions use verified digit-only answers with fresh-dialog checks; batch answers advance automatically, Other opens Hermes' own text entry, and unfamiliar or checkbox dialogs retain the terminal controls. Keep the model/status strip visible during clarify prompts and exclude countdown/metric repaint from the card identity. ([1b8f8290](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/1b8f8290))

### Fixed

- **Hermes diffs use continuous Codex-colored rectangular backgrounds.** Extend painted added and deleted lines across the mirror with equal side gutters and no gaps between rows, using Codex's soft green and red fills while preserving text, wrapping and raw terminal output. ([1b8f8290](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/1b8f8290))

## [1.8.0+collie.7] - 2026-09-10

### Changed

- **Codex operation hints stay below the statusline while working.** Lift only the interrupt and queue hints actually printed beside the live composer into one optional, horizontally scrollable row that stays current while browsing history. Keep Working and elapsed time in the transcript, preserve ANSI colors, and leave dialog controls and guarded sending unchanged. ([303c18dc](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/303c18dc))

## [1.8.0+collie.6] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- **Hermes input separators span the full conversation width.** Extend only verified submitted-message borders to the mirror gutters, retain original terminal text and raw-mode widths, and give italic operation hints enough line height to keep descenders visible while scrolling horizontally. ([f524aa19](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/f524aa19))

## [1.8.0+collie.5] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- **Keep Hermes working status and hints above the composer.** Recognize the default and minimal working prompts, lift the verified operation hint into a second fixed status row, and retain real drafts and unfamiliar prompts in the terminal mirror. ([ee5dba8a](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/ee5dba8a))
- **Reveal the selected tab when opening a pane.** Scroll the tab strip horizontally on selection and layout changes so the active tab remains reachable, while preserving manual browsing across ordinary status polls and leaving page scroll and terminal focus untouched. ([ee5dba8a](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/ee5dba8a))

## [1.8.0+collie.4] - 2026-09-10

### Changed

- **Hermes status shows the full model and saved effort.** Read only those display fields from the matching session journal, keep the model untruncated in the scrolling strip, and append an explicitly recorded reasoning level after a space. Missing or mismatched metadata keeps the terminal's own text. ([a235c2c8](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/a235c2c8))

### Fixed

- **Hermes reply borders keep their rounded corners on phones.** Fit the opening and closing rules to one row without dropping their label, curved ends or original source text. ([a235c2c8](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/a235c2c8))

## [1.8.0+collie.3] - 2026-09-10

### Changed

- **Hermes terminal chrome fits the phone conversation view.** Collapse verified reply borders to their label, move status fields into the compact scrolling strip with a context-used ring, and hide the empty terminal composer. Preserve real drafts, unrecognized screens and the existing Hermes send path. ([4af86acd](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/4af86acd))

## [1.8.0+collie.2] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- **Hermes uses its official website icon throughout the app.** Bundle the original Nous portrait with its source and license, and explain that a new Hermes session reports its identity after the first message before suggesting integration repair. ([c5cf25ef](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/c5cf25ef))

## [1.8.0+collie.1] - 2026-09-10

### Changed

- **Collie follows upstream v1.8.0.** Adopt crew protocol v2 and state migration, Hermes transcripts, verified OMP multipart input and PWA update recovery; retain downstream Codex send safeguards, compact controls and iOS safe-area coverage. [Complete upstream changes and integration decisions](./docs/upstream-v1.8.0.md). ([57c171a2](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/57c171a2))
## [1.9.1] - 2026-09-15

### Added

- **An urgent patch keeps the daily update cadence.** A fix operators must take today, data loss, a security hole, a broken update path, carries one `**Urgent.**` line under its changelog heading. The release publishes that line in its `collie-release.json` sidecar and on its release page, and the phone then tells you at the release or at the next 09:00 after it, instead of folding the fix into the weekly patch digest. The push opens with the release's own sentence, the update card prints it beside a short Urgent label, and the band carries the label. One urgent release makes the whole waiting train daily; the version stays an ordinary patch. ([53dbaaa2](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/53dbaaa2))

### Changed

- **The actions belt stands at 40px, and the reply field's focus ring has room to breathe.** The belt under the pane read as a thin strip on the phone at the pill's own 32px; it now carries 4px above and below the pills, and the harness section's tint still runs from rule to rule. The reply field's focus ring used to land on the belt's bottom edge; the field row now keeps 4px above the field, so the ring clears the belt above and the chrome below by the same margin. ([a0ae39e7](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/a0ae39e7))

### Fixed

- **A finished agent no longer hides in Recent on Herdr 0.9.** Herdr 0.9 says `idle` on its API for an agent whose turn ended, and only its own client turns that into `done`, so a completion sat in Recent with no mark and Ready · unseen looked empty. Collie now counts a settled pane, `idle` or `done`, as unseen when its last turn ended after you last opened it, shells excluded. Only a turn that ends counts as new work, so Herdr's own acknowledgement and detection flicker do not re-mark a pane you have read, and an agent that exits takes its unread history with it. On tmux and zellij the same rule lifts a beacon-reported pane into Ready · unseen when its turn ends. After the update, a pane that finished earlier and was never opened may show as unseen once; opening it clears it. Thanks @magoz (#222). ([769cdaa8](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/769cdaa8))
- **Muse panes render natively in light mode.** The mirror no longer inverts Muse's mid-tone palette into a 2:1 grey-on-white; the pane sits on the page ground with only bright foregrounds resolved dark, and dark rendering is unchanged. Thanks @jpcarranza94 (#220, ADR 0047). ([7e521c6d](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/7e521c6d))
- **A Codex pane stops painting a black bar again when Codex changes its fill.** The mirror's light-fill rule reads luminance instead of one exact colour, so the band Codex 0.154.0 paints four levels off the reported value is caught like the original, and the next one will be too. The rule is one module shared with omp; each adapter names its own floor. Thanks @foreverrrree (#224, follow-up to #144).

### Docs

- **The install page opens with Install, Update and Uninstall, each spelled for a Herdr plugin and for a standalone install.** A table at the top says how to tell the two kinds apart, how their verbs are spelled, and where each keeps its config and state. Packages get one line per manager in those three sections and keep their long notes further down. Uninstall is now three steps, service, program, own files, with the paths that stay behind. ([ef776e9b](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/ef776e9b))

## [1.9.0] - 2026-09-14

### Added

- **One row of actions above the keyboard, with the running agent's own commands in it.** Keys, Type, Quick, Agent and the display gear share a single scrolling row with the harness's commands, which sit in a segment tinted with that harness's brand colour and carry an icon each. Claude Code panes get Model, Effort, Compact and Resume; Codex, pi and omp get their own. Every button sends its bare command and the harness paints its own picker in the mirror, so the list of models or effort levels never lives in Collie. Operators add or replace the segment with `bar = true` in `commands.toml`; Settings, Harness shortcuts, hides it per device. ([fc8d1be9](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/fc8d1be9))
- **A config file carries every setting.** `~/.collie/config.toml` sets any Collie setting in TOML for the whole machine, and a `config.toml` beside your `.env` overrides it for one instance; the environment and your `.env` still win over both, and a broken key never stops the bridge from starting. ([1df9edd4](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/1df9edd4))
- **Three verbs for that file.** `collie config init` writes a commented file with every setting and its default, `collie config check` validates one, and `collie config show` prints both file paths and every setting with its effective value and where it came from. ([95a2f7b1](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/95a2f7b1))
- **Cache rules are dated, sourced claims, and `collie doctor` says when one goes stale.** Every TTL carries the vendor page it was read on and the date it was read; a claim older than 180 days is a doctor warning, and one older than a year fails the build. ([49484669](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/49484669))
- **`cache-rules.toml` moves a TTL your provider changed.** It sits beside `commands.toml`, overrides one rule id, and must carry the page you read and the date you read it. ([74004b6c](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/74004b6c))
- **Every agent pane shows how long its prompt cache stays warm.** A chip on the dashboard card and in the pane header counts down from the harness's last request: green while the window is wide, red in its last quarter, and blue once the cache goes cold. A tap on the pane screen opens the rule, its source and the date it was last checked. ([f12f7a63](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/f12f7a63))
- **The first launch is one screen that says what Collie does and what this install looks like.** It names the multiplexer and the machine it mirrors, counts the panes and the ones blocked on you, says whether this device may type and how many machines are in your crew, offers at most two things to do about it, and closes with the six things you can do here. Shown once per device; Settings shows it again. ([a9c6c22f](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/a9c6c22f))
- **A push warns you before a pane's prompt cache goes cold.** Switch it on for one pane from its settings sheet, or for every pane under Settings → Notify when, where the panes you watched one by one are listed. The warning fires once per warm cycle, honours the snooze, and `COLLIE_CACHE_WARN_SECONDS` moves its 300-second window. ([eeedfabf](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/eeedfabf))
- **omp's harness bar has a Tree button.** It sits between Compact and Resume, the order pi's bar already uses, and opens omp's own session tree in the mirror. `/tree` joins the omp command palette with it. ([cc38c2de](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/cc38c2de))

### Changed

- **A crew member too old to speak the current protocol is now a red preflight, not a silent link.**
  The lead's `collie update --check` walk names a protocol floor: 1.8.0 is the oldest build that
  speaks crew protocol 2. A member below it, under a lead at 1.9.0 or newer, reds the `version`
  check with both versions and the remedy, which blocks the crew update instead of starting a roll
  that cannot finish. A version the lead cannot parse stays amber, as before. A state directory that
  still carries 1.7.0's `pack-*.json` names is now named at start, with the two hand edits printed
  in full. ([6e97194c](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/6e97194c))
- **The crew link speaks one version again: the 1.7.0 compatibility layer is gone.** 1.8.0 kept the
  old `/pack/v1/*` paths, the `COLLIE_PACK_*` timeout keys, the `pack-*.json` state-file rename, the
  `/api/pack` redirect and every `packId` reader alive for one release so a 1.7.0 member could
  follow the update roll. All of it is removed. Bring every member to 1.8.x before you move the lead
  to 1.9.0: a member still on 1.7.0 now shows red on the lead's preflight, naming both versions and
  the remedy, and reads as `incompatible` in `crew status`. The `collie pack` command alias, `collie
  docs pack` and the app's `/pack` address are untouched and stay until 2.0.0. ([fe8eec0b](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/fe8eec0b))
- **The config schema names the cache warn window.** `COLLIE_CACHE_WARN_SECONDS` has its row, so `collie config show` and `config init` carry it. ([44317201](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/44317201))
- **The config schema forgets the 1.7.0 pack keys.** The two `COLLIE_PACK_*` timeout aliases left with the crew wire overlap, so `collie config show` no longer lists them. ([cdafe05a](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/cdafe05a))
- **The agent card drops the relative-time chip.** The prompt-cache countdown next to it says what matters; the extra number read as a session clock and confused. ([cd70aa30](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/cd70aa30))
- **The dashboard row carries its machine and cache reading on the name line.** The host chip and the cache countdown ride at the end of the pane's name, on every row of the dashboard, and the second line is the place alone, so a row is two lines and never three; an empty reading leaves its space, so nothing slides. ([cc5965d3](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/cc5965d3))
- **The cache countdown carries an hourglass mark in one quiet ink per state.** The chip on the dashboard row and in the pane header opens with one fixed hourglass glyph, so the number reads as a cache reading beside the host chip's server mark rather than as a loose word. The hourglass is green while the window is wide, red in its last quarter, and blue once the cache goes cold; the machine's identity tint is left to the host chip beside it. ([d3a52e25](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d3a52e25))
- **The key rail fades and shows a chevron on the edge that still hides content.** The scrolling row of harness shortcuts above the keys says which way it scrolls, so a rail wider than the screen no longer looks like it ends at the last visible button. ([abccd401](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/abccd401))
- **The actions row is a belt.** One full-bleed band sits above the input, flush under the mirror: Collie's own controls run on a scrolling track tinted with the brand colour, and the harness's commands sit in a section tinted with the harness's colour. The fixed Switch cell sits at the right, on the composer's own ground, behind a hairline. The track's right edge carries exactly one constant fade and no chevron, and the last pill always scrolls fully into view; the Switch pill's tap area ends at its own hairline. Every pill is an icon and a word, so Collie's controls and the harness's commands read as one family. ([9b530786](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/9b530786))
- **The pane's status word leaves the composer.** The thin line above the controls that named the machine and the pane's state is gone; the state now stays on the header's dot and on the dashboard. ([adaa1fb3](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/adaa1fb3))
- **A bare Switch mark at the end of the actions belt opens the pane switcher.** The belt's right end carries the layers glyph above Send, behind a hairline and with no word or border of its own; a drag up from anywhere on the belt also opens the switcher, a sideways drag still scrolls it, and the 30px handle band above the composer is gone. ([931f857a](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/931f857a))
- **The machine's name moves into the pane header, onto the path line.** The header's second line names the workspace, and on a crew the host name and the cache countdown ride at its end. The pane menu stands alone in the corner; place and meta stand on one baseline; the actions belt no longer carries the name. ([931f857a](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/931f857a))
- **One name on every screen.** A pane is called the same thing on the dashboard, in the switcher, on its own header, on its pill and in a push: the name you gave it, else the name the agent gave its session, else the title the pane's program prints, else the word for the agent running there. The pane header no longer leads with the space and tab, and no screen falls back to a directory for a name. ([6e8eeafc](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/6e8eeafc))
- **The place is the second line, and only the second line.** `space › tab` sits under the name on the dashboard row, in the switcher row and in a push; the pane header shows the workspace alone, because the tab strip under it already names the open tab. A card already grouped under its tab keeps the directory there instead, since its place is the heading above it. ([6e8eeafc](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/6e8eeafc))
- **A tab the multiplexer only numbered reads its position, not nothing.** A multiplexer labels an unnamed tab by position, "1" or "Tab #2"; that number now reads as `tab 2` in a lighter ink on every surface, the tab strip, the pane header's crumb and the dashboard rows alike, instead of a dot. A tab with no label at all still shows nothing, and a screen reader still hears the raw label. ([583e561d](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/583e561d))
- **Rows keep their order.** The bridge sends every pane in the multiplexer's own arrangement, space then tab then the pane's place in that tab, and the dashboard, the switcher and the pane strip keep it rather than re-sorting by activity or by pane id. A row moves when it changes section, not while you reach for it, and the dashboard's list of spaces now runs in the same order as the space strip. ([6e8eeafc](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/6e8eeafc))
- **The dashboard's rows sit under the workspace they live in.** What needs you stays on top, by urgency, listed once and never again under its workspace group; every other pane now sits under a heading that names its workspace and counts what is inside it, in the multiplexer's own machine and workspace order. Each row carries its tab on a second line, or `tab 2` when the tab has only a number. The name sits in the middle of the row when the tab has neither, and every row of a group is the same height. Bare shells join their tab's group after its agents. The Working and Recent headings are gone with them, and so are Recent's fold and its sort toggle. ([64b6f499](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/64b6f499))
- **The tab row and the pane row under the header get compact.** Tab row 32px, pane pills 24px, text 11px, the size of the header's path line; every pill still answers a 44px tap. The tab row draws no horizontal rule and no hairlines between tabs; the open tab is an outlined pill on the row's own ground. The tab row and the pane row beneath it are one continuous band, sharing one ground rather than falling through to the page's ambient black. ([c2a16502](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/c2a16502))
- **A tmux window tmux named itself shows its folder, not its program.** With automatic-rename on, the tab's name is the last folder of the window's active pane; a window you named keeps its name. ([f90b7410](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/f90b7410))
- **The dashboard's attention rows are as compact as the workspace rows.** "Needs you" and "Ready · unseen" used to be tall standalone cards above a list of short rows, two shapes for one kind of thing; every row now shares the 44px form in one framed list, and a finished pane you have not opened yet carries a small dot after its name. ([10cd0557](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/10cd0557))
- **The composer's belt is a third shorter, and its scroll fade is twice as long.** The belt now stands at the pill height, 32px instead of 44px, the Switch mark narrows from 44 to 32px, and the fade under it runs over 64px so the belt reads as a strip that keeps going. The belt also no longer scrolls vertically under a thumb, in Safari either. ([5e7f626c](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/5e7f626c), [63513aee](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/63513aee))

### Fixed

- **A pane's cache countdown survives a `/compact`.** A transcript probe that finds no turn inside its 128 KB window now keeps the last reading and lets it age, instead of dropping the pane's countdown for good. ([05065d54](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/05065d54))
- **A measured cache window cites the rule it was really measured on.** A Claude pane on a subscription measures the one-hour window, so the sheet now quotes the subscription page and date instead of the five-minute API page the tier guess had picked. ([068e2e28](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/068e2e28))
- **A member serving plain HTTP no longer reads as a rejected certificate.** `collie doctor` and `crew status` said "the TLS certificate was not accepted" for a member that answered with no TLS at all, which sent the operator to a pin that was never consulted; the reason now says the address answers over plain HTTP, the same sentence `collie join` already gives. ([80e262d7](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/80e262d7))
- **A URL the pane wrapped is one whole link again.** A URL longer than the pane was cut at the column edge, so only its first row became a link, and that link opened a truncated URL. On Herdr the bridge now reads the same rows with soft wraps undone when a URL runs to a row's end, and every row of that URL opens the whole URL. Thanks @thelinuxlich (#212). ([e44d35c8](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/e44d35c8))
- **A wrapped Codex question card is recognised instead of falling back to raw.** A long question, a description, or the `esc to interrupt` hint can each wrap onto their own row, and `ask.ts` now joins a wrapped row back into the question or description it belongs to, accepting a continuation only when it starts at or beyond that description's own column. The digit recipe is unchanged. Thanks @alvinycheung (#201). ([e44d35c8](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/e44d35c8))
- **The history view reads in the chosen terminal font.** The full-transcript reading page ignored Settings → Terminal font and always rendered in the shipped default face; it now applies the same font to its own `ChatMessageList`, matching the live pane mirror. Thanks @fjse (#216). ([e44d35c8](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/e44d35c8))
- **A multi-agent push notification names the panes, not the agent kind.** With several agents blocked at once the body read `claude, claude, claude`; it now shows each pane's own label, falling back to its folder name and then its agent kind, and adds the workspace when two panes still match. Thanks @caioreis123 (#215). ([15f9db67](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/15f9db67))
- **A peer's own space gets its blocked dot and recency back on the dashboard and in the space strip.** Both matched a space by workspace id alone, or kept keying it to the lead regardless of `?h=`, so a peer's identically-numbered space showed no dot and no order, and the lead's own blocked agent could colour a peer's chip. Both now key off the addressed host, the same one the loader already narrows a peer's spaces and tabs to. Thanks @namseokyoo (#209). ([2fc6a3a0](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/2fc6a3a0))
- **`hooks install` writes through a symlinked `~/.claude`, and still refuses a symlinked settings file.** Stow, chezmoi and similar tools point the whole config directory elsewhere; the write now follows that link instead of refusing it, while a settings file that is itself a symlink (home-manager's read-only profile) is still refused, with a worded error rather than a raw write failure for a dangling or unwritable link. Thanks @cryptiklemur (#190). ([ae078d89](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/ae078d89))
- **An update tapped on a Mac phone no longer leaves the service unloaded.** On macOS neither `systemd-run` nor a `setsid` binary exists, so the bridge started the update runner inside the launchd job's process group; restarting the job killed the runner before it could load the job again. The bridge now spawns that runner in a session of its own on every tier except `systemd-run`, which stays as it was. If a phone update has already left the service unloaded, `collie restart` loads it again. Thanks @PhillipChaffee (#213). ([eeadde63](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/eeadde63))
- **`collie doctor` no longer credits a commented-out cache rule.** The `cache-env` check read the example file's commented rows as a live override; it now counts only rows that validate, and a `retrieved` date in the future is rejected like any other bad row. ([8f8d149f](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/8f8d149f))
- **The cache countdown no longer blinks between polls.** A refresh that arrived without a reading unmounted the chip for a frame and put it back on the next poll; the last reading now holds until a new one, or an explicit cold, replaces it, and it is dropped when the pane goes away. ([d777c559](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d777c559))
- **The pane title no longer shows a raw pane id.** A tab with several unnamed panes appended the multiplexer's `p3` to the title and printed it on every pill of the switcher; the title names the tab now, and a pill carries its place in the row only when a pill beside it would otherwise read the same. ([2eefd38e](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/2eefd38e))
- **A second Herdr session no longer wipes the first one's cache readings.** The bridge's cache tracker forgot every reading a session's poll did not name, including the other session's, so each poll dropped and re-probed every pane; a poll now forgets only its own session's departed panes, and a transient probe failure keeps the last reading. ([22c79342](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/22c79342))
- **The cold-cache push now fires for panes on a five-minute cache.** Codex, OpenCode, pi and omp all default to a 300-second TTL, no longer than the configured warn window, so the push skipped them outright; it now warns at half the pane's own cache lifetime whenever that is shorter than the configured window, about two and a half minutes before those panes go cold. ([d2811bc9](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d2811bc9))

## [1.8.2] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- **The service worker precaches only its own channel's icons.** A release build's precache no longer carries the dev build's or the playground's icon files, and vice versa: entries dropped from 37 (1660.11 KiB) to 28 (1485.71 KiB) in a same-channel build. ([d43fcf80](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d43fcf80))
- **Static files ship gzipped, so an update downloads in a quarter of the time.** Only JSON API replies were compressed; the app bundle, the stylesheet and the service worker went out raw, so a phone precaching an update pulled the whole thing over the tailnet and showed the app as offline until it finished. Every text asset is now compressed when the browser offers `gzip`, and a compressed asset is cached in memory so the work is done once per build rather than once per request. The main chunk goes from 869 kB to 250 kB; images and fonts are untouched, since they are already compressed. ([9b484bdb](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/9b484bdb))
- **The update band waits for the new bundle instead of reloading early.** Tapping "tap to reload" while the new version was still downloading reloaded the phone onto the old app shell, which then asked for a chunk that no longer existed, so the loading dog ran forever and only a second manual reload fixed it. The page now reloads only once the new service worker is in control, the band says the new version is downloading for as long as that takes, and the eight-second guard fires only when nothing is on its way in. ([44b7afb1](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/44b7afb1))
- **The downloading band can be closed, and the app stays usable meanwhile.** A download that never finishes, on a link that has gone away, is now one you can put down: the row closes, the app on screen goes on working from the bundle it already has, and nothing is declined — the install carries on in the background and the page still reloads itself once the new version takes over. ([5646f7e6](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/5646f7e6))

## [1.8.1] - 2026-09-12

### Added

- **Opening a pane now slides the screen in, and going back slides it back.** The arriving screen enters from the right on the way into a pane and from the left on the way back, 240ms and eased, with the band, the header and the Collie mark holding still. Every other navigation is silent, including a poll revalidation and a machine or session switch: this is a plain entrance animation on the route region, not the View Transitions API removed in 0.10.0 for flickering the page on every poll. Reduced motion gets the new screen in place, with no slide. ([d24a4d73](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d24a4d73))
- **The playground has Notices and Motion tabs.** Notices shows the notice family, the strip band, the connection recovery flash, the update ribbon and the status toast. Motion shows the collapse and swap primitives, loading states, sheets, menus, and pending and pulsing controls. Every card carries a Replay control, and the ones that swap between states also carry a Slow toggle. Motion opens with a walkthrough of the real app, every route on fixture data inside a phone frame, with the live route, shortcut buttons and a frame meter for each move. ([9429bd61](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/9429bd61))
- **A dev build wears an orange icon, and the playground a red one.** A build whose HEAD isn't the release tag now installs as "Collie (dev)" with orange favicons and manifest tiles, so it is never mistaken for the release build on the same home screen; the states playground gets its own red favicon set. The release build's `index.html` and manifest are unchanged. ([c7c4cc9e](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/c7c4cc9e))

### Changed

- **The states playground is now a tabbed page instead of one long scroll.** The tab list and the theme/clock/typeface/accent controls sit in a sidebar on wide screens and a top bar on narrow ones; only the selected section mounts, so switching sections no longer means scrolling past several of them to reach one. The tabs open with Dashboard, then Pane, Crew and Settings, then Boot & connection, Idle & resume and Brand, then Notices and Motion. The selected tab lives in the URL hash (`#pane`, or `#pane/<card-handle>` to also scroll to a card), remembered in `localStorage` between visits. Within a tab, cards are grouped under a small labelled `Group`, ordered from the everyday state to the rare one, so a tab with a dozen cards can be skimmed by its group titles. `app.tsx` (1600+ lines) is split into one file per section under `src/playground/sections/`, registered in a small `SECTIONS` table. ([9429bd61](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/9429bd61))
- **The Keys tray is less than half its old height.** One seven-column pad replaces the old Keys/123 toggle and stacked rows, with Space in the middle of the bottom row, and 123, Presets and F keys now sit behind one row of chips instead of two separate disclosures. Measured at a 390px-wide viewport: 275px tall before, 119px tall now, every key still at least 36px tall. ([e12b4334](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/e12b4334))

### Fixed

- **The playground's crew fixtures named real machines, not fictional ones.** The lead and deputy are now `lodge` and `workshop`, matching the fixture set's own outbuilding theme (attic, cellar, garage, loft, shed, barn, kennel). These fixtures mount into colliepwa.dev's feature screens, so this stops the real names from reaching new builds of the public site; a dead re-export of the unit-test fixtures was also dropped from this file's public surface, since it carried the same two names and nothing read it. ([260dbe46](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/260dbe46))
- **The dashboard-row playground card named real machines, a real username and real clients.** `dashboard-live.ts`'s frozen snapshot carried the real host id and host name a dozen-odd times (now `lodge`/`workshop`, matching the crew fixtures' outbuilding theme), plus the operator's real OS username and several real client/project codenames throughout its `cwd`, label and session fields — a bigger exposure than the hostnames, now swapped for same-shape fakes. This card is dev-only and was never imported by colliepwa.dev, so nothing public was showing these names, but a future import could have carried them out unnoticed; the website repo now runs a build-time check against exactly that (`bun run build:app`), so a real name reaching `public/app/` fails the build instead of shipping quietly. ([4269ae2d](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/4269ae2d))
- **The top of the app no longer reserves the iPhone notch three times over.** The update ribbon, the connection bar and the header each set `env(safe-area-inset-top)` for themselves, each written when it was the first thing on the screen, so any two of them at once left a tall dead band above the notice — the everyday ribbon-plus-header case on iOS. The band above the header now shows one strip at a time and owns the inset while it is open; the header reserves it only while the band is empty, and the handover rides the band's own 240ms open and close, so nothing jumps. The update offer and the connection bar are `ui/notice.tsx` strips now, which also ends two copies of the tint recipe, two hand-rolled collapse animations, and two rows that asked a screen reader to be assertive and polite at once. The offer's states that carry a ✕ trade their row-wide tap for a named View button, since a button may not hold a button. ([59c77fc3](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/59c77fc3))
- **The update ribbon's text no longer says "Tap to update".** The dismissible ribbon states navigate through the View button beside the ✕, so the row itself no longer taps, and the copy in all seven locales now says only that the version is available. ([15bd0bbd](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/15bd0bbd))
- **The "tap to update" band is a named button again.** The band's text sits in a live region, which does not name the button around it; the button now names itself from that text. ([93a4ecc2](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/93a4ecc2))
- **A long tab row scrolls its active tab into view.** On arrival and on every selection change, the Spaces, Tabs and Panes strips now carry their active item to the nearest visible edge: instant on arrival, smoothly afterwards, and a workspace with many tabs no longer opens on a tab that's scrolled off-screen. ([8a774cc4](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/8a774cc4))
- **The "Collie on" header line no longer flickers on the dashboard.** The header identity stays mounted across routes and only hides inside a pane, so the multiplexer's logo is fetched once per page instead of once per dashboard open. Over a tailnet that fetch left the logo box blank for a round trip every time you came back from a pane. ([1b3939cf](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/1b3939cf))
- **Opening the dashboard no longer re-reads the bridge config.** The footer build stamp asked for it on every mount and threw the answer away once the build was known. ([e3c7816e](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/e3c7816e))
- **A checkout on an untagged release commit builds as dev.** The channel now reads the tags the checkout holds; a tree with no git and a shallow install with no tags still build as release. ([ee3338a2](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/ee3338a2))
- **The top of the app is no longer blurred on iOS 27.** iOS 27 blurs the top edge of a Home Screen web app whose status bar is translucent, into the header. The status bar is opaque now; the header already paints the page colour under it, and iOS 26 and later colour the bar from that. iOS reads the style once, when you add the app to the Home Screen, so an install made before this change stays blurred until you remove it and add it again. Thanks @bendrucker (#203). ([1907ce2e](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/1907ce2e))
- **A light fill in an omp pane no longer reads as a black bar.** The phone renders the mirror dark and inverts it, so a light ANSI background came through as a solid black block with the text lost inside it. omp's light fills now carry the same `mobileTransparentBg` hint the codex adapter already uses, and the phone drops the fill and keeps the text. Which fills count is decided by luminance rather than by a theme palette, so dark fills, diff colours among them, are unchanged. Thanks @tenngoxars (#206). ([64f0d698](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/64f0d698))
- **A peer's space now lists its own panes instead of every tab reading empty.** In a crew, the space screen grouped panes on the machine leading the crew rather than on the machine the space is on, so opening a peer's space drew "(empty tab)" under every tab while the header still counted the panes. Refs #209. ([5784191b](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/5784191b))

### Docs

- **The docs show how to install and update the PWA itself, not just the host.** `docs/install.md` gains two screenshots of the Install card at the top of Settings — the button Chrome and Edge offer, and the share-sheet hint iOS shows instead — since neither existed anywhere before. The Updates screenshots in `docs/upgrading.md` are regenerated too: two still read "Update pack to" and "Retry pack update" from before the crew rename, and one named a real Tailscale hostname (`minibuch`) in its rolled-back-peer example. `scripts/docs-screens.sh`, which generates this whole set, carried both and is what's actually fixed; the images are just its output. ([22d20160](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/22d20160))
- **`scripts/docs-screens.sh` no longer races its own screenshots.** Every capture now scrolls its target flush to the top before the shot, not just the two newest ones: the previous `agent-browser scrollintoview` call centres an element and can still be mid-animation when the screenshot fires, silently cropping the top off. Also tightens the two install-path Notes in `docs/install.md` to open with the platform they apply to, so a reader can tell at a glance which one is theirs. ([1f444d6d](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/1f444d6d))
- **The omp fixture corpus now covers the tool-approval dialog.** That screen was the corpus's one known gap, and the adapter's own comments said so: the claim that Collie refuses to type into it rested on inference, not on a capture. Three captures close it — a `bash` approval and a `write` approval in both selection states, taken against omp v18.1.17 — and the suite now asserts raw-only blocks and `composerReady === false` on them. The prose and the modal counts in `omp/chrome.ts`, `omp/index.ts` and `omp/markers.ts` are corrected to match. Thanks @christensenjames (#204). ([3a4f68db](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/3a4f68db))

## [1.8.0] - 2026-09-09

### Added

- **A real browser opens the app on every push.** CI gained a second job that builds the web bundle, serves it, answers the API from the same fixtures the unit tests use, and opens the app in Chromium at a phone size and a tablet size. It runs beside the existing typecheck and test job, so a browser failure and a lint failure both report in one run, and it uploads a screenshot and a trace when something fails. Nothing about the shipped app changes; the release path downloads no browser. ([051b30e2](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/051b30e2))
- **Thirteen checks that were run by hand now run themselves.** `web/e2e/issue-180.spec.ts` holds seven browser cases for terminal graphics in the mirror, from a placeholder run that shows the journal's picture to a search highlight that has to land on the right character below one. `web/e2e/m24-crew.spec.ts` holds six for the crew page, the `/pack` to `/crew` redirect, the Settings and footer entries, and the Japanese locale. `web/e2e/fixtures/mirror.ts` builds the screen those cases read, the journal turn behind it, and the three answers a blob can give, each one a patch on a fixture the unit suite already uses. ([1448b1a7](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/1448b1a7))
- **Hermes panes get transcript history.** Collie reads Hermes SessionDB through the exact Herdr session ID, including compressed parent sessions, without writing to Hermes state. ([85e0da5e](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/85e0da5e))
- **The update notice says when a release changes the crew link.** An install that is part of a crew reads the new `collie-release.json` asset every release now publishes, sees that the release ahead speaks a different crew wire version, and says so on the band, above the confirm on the Updates card and in the daily push: update the lead first, the members follow. The reading is a number, not a release name, so the release after this one says it too. A solo install says nothing, the confirm button keeps its wording, and every release before 1.8.0 published no asset and reads as no change. ([f39cbddc](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/f39cbddc))
- **Seven browser cases pin the update path from one bundle to the next.** The browser tier now builds the web bundle twice and serves either build from a swappable path, so a page holding the precached shell of one build can be handed the other, which is what a deploy looks like to a phone. The cases cover the footer chip, the automatic check, a tap during an install, a proxy sign-in path the precache must never answer, and the three paths that fit the 2026-09-09 stall: a failed worker-script fetch, three taps on one installing worker, and the stuck guard reloading onto the stale build. ([bb095e3a](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/bb095e3a))

### Changed

- **Update the lead first: the crew wire moves to protocol version 2.** This completes the rename that 1.7.0 began: 1.7.0 changed what you read, 1.8.0 changes what the machines read. The paths become `/crew/v1/*`, the headers `X-Crew-*`, the signing contexts `collie-crew-warrant-v2` and `collie-crew-dial-v2`, and `CREW_PROTOCOL_VERSION` is 2. A 1.8.0 lead keeps answering `/pack/v1/*` in the version 1 shapes for one release, and a 1.8.0 member falls back to that prefix once against a lead still on 1.7.0 and writes one journal line per lead saying it did, so a crew can be rolled lead first with no member cut off. The fallback fires on the answer a 1.7.0 collie really gives an unknown path, the app shell served with `Content-Type: text/html`, as well as on a `404`, a `403` and a version 1 header. The crew id in a warrant, in a standby-device sync and in the enroll answer is written `crewId` and read under either spelling, so no signature and no stored file changes meaning. Both halves of that overlap are removed in 1.9.0, from when a 1.7.0 member no longer talks to a newer lead. ([305c3291](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/305c3291))
- **Every state card in the playground carries a stable handle.** The dev-only states page now renders a `data-state` id on each card, flat kebab-case and unique across the page, so a browser test can address "the update band with a run in flight" without matching the card's prose label. The handle is a required prop, so a new card cannot be added without one, and a unit test refuses a repeat. The controls that switch a card between two states gained accessible names for the same reason. Nothing changes in the shipped bundle: the playground stays out of `web/dist`. ([48286a70](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/48286a70))
- **The crew's own files and identifiers say crew.** `bridge/pack/` is now `bridge/crew/`, `cli/pack.ts` is `cli/crew.ts`, the phone's crew route and its four components follow, and every `Pack…` type, function and constant is spelled `Crew…`, as are the `pack.*` translation keys. Nothing moves on the wire, on disk or in the environment: the `/pack/v1/*` paths, the `X-Pack-*` headers, `PACK_PROTOCOL_VERSION`, `COLLIE_PACK_*`, the three `pack-*.json` state files, the `[pack]` journal prefix, `/api/pack` and the `collie pack` alias all keep their names in this change. The commit-hook hatch is now `SKIP_CREW_WIRE_CHECK=1`. ([12c746f7](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/12c746f7))
- **The environment keys, the state files, the journal and the census say crew.** Reading the crew's own names: `COLLIE_CREW_TIMEOUT_MS` and `COLLIE_CREW_HELLO_TIMEOUT_MS` replace the `COLLIE_PACK_*` pair, `~/.local/state/collie/pack-trust.json`, `pack-ops.json` and `pack-runtime.json` are renamed to `crew-trust.json`, `crew-ops.json` and `crew-runtime.json` on the first start, the journal prefix is `[crew]`, a forwarded write is audited as `via: "crew"`, the phone reads the census at `/api/crew`, and the crew's update rows on `/api/update/check` and inside every `collie update --check --json` document are `crew` rather than `pack`, with `dismissedCrewVersion` for `dismissedPackVersion` in `update-state.json`. Nothing is lost and nothing has to be edited today: each old name still works for this one release, an old state file is moved rather than copied, the old inner keys (`pack`, `packId`) are read once and written back as `crew` and `crewId`, a preflight document printed by a member still on 1.7.0 is read under either spelling, the old dismiss key is read once and written back under the new one, `/api/pack` answers a 308 to `/api/crew`, and one warning line at start names any old environment key still in use. Every one of those overlaps is removed in 1.9.0, so rename the two keys in your own `.env` before then. On a journal that spans the update, grep for both prefixes. If you have a script that greps `[pack]`, reads `pack-trust.json` or calls `/api/pack`, it needs the crew names now; `/api/pack` answers 308 for one release, the rest does not. ([c529e3fd](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/c529e3fd))

### Fixed

- **A reply on OMP's Pi composer could be sent before Enter had actually confirmed it, or with a completion the user never accepted.** The guard now reads the draft back and verifies it before sending, so an unconfirmed line is not silently dropped or included as if it had been typed. A ghost completion Pi offered but the user did not accept is stripped before send. A multiline reply now goes out in verified parts, not as one unchecked block. The paste chip is treated as opaque, since it never showed what would actually be pasted, so it can no longer count as evidence that Enter worked. Thanks SeongQ kim (#192), closes #34. ([47369fb4](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/47369fb4))
- **A stale member record made `collie crew update <member>` impossible to fix.** The preflight walked every member over ssh using the route the ops file remembered, and it ran before `--host`, `--path` and `--port` were used against a machine. A record pointing at a checkout that had moved therefore went red with a remedy naming those exact flags, and passing them changed nothing. The overrides now reach the walk, so the printed remedy clears the red on the next run. ([03eb7a87](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/03eb7a87))
- **A second tap escapes the update that keeps coming back stale.** When the eight-second guard behind "new build, tap to update" reloads the page and the phone comes back on the same old bundle, the next tap now unregisters the service worker and reloads from the bridge instead of starting the identical wait again. It only does that while the bridge is still answering the ordinary poll, so an offline install keeps its precache and its stale bundle rather than landing on an error page. This is the 1.6.0 to 1.7.0 stall on the release lane, where every tap cost a reload and the new bundle took about three minutes to arrive. ([bb095e3a](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/bb095e3a))

### Docs

- **The new browser suite has a place in the docs.** `CLAUDE.md` says how to run each tier and how to add a case, `CONTRIBUTING.md` tells a contributor CI runs it and they need not, and the workspace README documents `make e2e`. ([2221ae8c](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/2221ae8c))

## [1.7.0+collie.1] - 2026-09-09

### Changed

- **Collie follows upstream v1.7.0.** Adopt crew naming, per-host multiplexer capabilities, reliable update progress and Pi/OMP journal images; retain downstream input safeguards, compact controls and iOS safe-area coverage. [Complete upstream changes and integration decisions](./docs/upstream-v1.7.0.md). ([8f198f46](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/8f198f46))

## [1.7.0] - 2026-09-09

### Added

- **The fetch and the build of an update report themselves.** A run record is written when staging begins instead of when it ends, and the steps are appended to a small file the bridge reads and folds into that record, so the phone shows what is happening over the longest part of an update instead of saying "Starting…" for a minute. A staging that gives up says so at once, rather than leaving a run that looks live for ten minutes with the button locked, and a second update started beside a live one no longer writes over the live one's record. ([90fc363a](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/90fc363a))
- **A running update proves it is running.** The Updates page shows which of the four steps it is on and a clock that ticks every second on the phone's own time, so it keeps moving through the restart when the bridge is unreachable and every poll fails. The page also polls fast while a run is in flight instead of every six seconds, and it dropped one of its three pollers. Past ninety seconds the restart stops saying it is not an outage and says what to check. The phase name and the moving counter are new in this release; seeing them during an update is expected. ([90fc363a](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/90fc363a), [bd3adc5f](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/bd3adc5f))
- **An AI coding agent in your terminal can read Collie's own manual with `collie skill` and `collie docs`.** `collie skill` prints a brief on how Collie works, and `collie docs` prints the operator pages, both out of the compiled binary rather than off disk, so a packaged install answers exactly what a checkout does and neither needs the network. `collie docs` lists the ten pages, `collie docs <name>` prints one, and `collie docs --all` prints every one behind a marker an agent can split on. `collie --skill` is the flag spelling of the first. ([3edb9667](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/3edb9667), [bd3adc5f](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/bd3adc5f))
- **A crew can be renamed.** `collie crew rename <name>` on the lead rewrites the crew's name and restarts the bridge, so `collie crew status` and the phone's crew page show it at once. The name is display data the lead hands out once at enrollment, so nothing is sent to a member: a machine that joins after the rename gets the new name, and the members already there keep the old string in a field nobody reads. It refuses on a peer and on a machine in no crew. A crew created without `--name` is called "collie crew". ([4d2f3f5b](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/4d2f3f5b))
- **`crew add` offers the hosts this machine already knows.** `collie crew add` with no target now lists candidates instead of printing the usage line: the `Host` entries in your `~/.ssh/config`, and the machines `herdr machine list --json` reports. One machine is one row, merged on the ssh target each name resolves to with `ssh -G`, which never connects. Each row says whether the name came from your ssh config, from herdr, or from both, and a row this lead already leads carries that member's id and is not offered. An `Include` is followed one level deep and only under `~/.ssh/`. Nothing is added until you pick a row, and the confirm still runs. With a target the verb behaves exactly as before. ([e54780ab](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/e54780ab))
- **A peer link tells reconnecting apart from needing you.** A member the lead cannot reach used to read one way whether it was a timeout or a wrong pack secret. The lead now says which it is: reconnecting means it is retrying and there is nothing for you to do, and it is no longer red, while needs attention means retrying will not fix it, and the crew page adds the sentence that says which. The lead also stamps every dial with a counter, so a slow answer from a dial it has already re-made is dropped and logged instead of overwriting a newer one. ([bd3adc5f](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/bd3adc5f))
- **Each machine in a crew answers for its own multiplexer.** A control on a member's pane used to be shown or hidden by what the lead's multiplexer can do, which is the wrong machine's answer whenever the two differ. Every member now reports its own capabilities to the lead over the pack link, and the lead answers `/api/config` per host from what it already holds, so it dials nobody to answer a page load. A member that says nothing keeps the lead's answer, which is exactly what it got before, so a peer running an older build changes in no way. ([bd3adc5f](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/bd3adc5f))
- **The mux conformance set can be run against a peer, through the lead.** `bun scripts/pack-mux-probe.ts --lead <url> --host <member>` points the read-only checks at a member's multiplexer over the pack link, with no host ever reaching a mux adapter. It reports what the pack surface cannot express instead of scoring those checks green: four port verbs have no forwardable route, the pane read fixes the grid request shape, and a capability that is a write is never sent across a live link. It has been run against a tmux member and a zellij member under a herdr lead, and both scored the same, so what fails is the route table and not the multiplexer. `MUX_CONTRACT.md` says which check is gradable on which side. ([bd3adc5f](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/bd3adc5f))
- **Images from an Oh My Pi or pi agent show up on the phone.** Where the agent leaves graphics placeholders on the screen, as Oh My Pi does with `PI_KITTY_PLACEHOLDERS=1`, the live mirror draws the picture beside them, matched by ORDER, so it is usually but not always the right one; the card says so on its face, and the pane's History is exact. pi draws its pictures without placeholders, so in this release they reached History only, not the live mirror (corrected after #292). History renders a picture the agent attached and a screenshot one of its tools returned, instead of dropping both, and in the mirror the black box becomes an image card, or an "[Image]" badge where the ordering had no image left to give. Only a journal blob or inline image bytes are loaded, never a web address out of the agent's log. A member's images are served by the machine whose journal named them and come through the lead, and a peer on an older build shows the badge rather than a broken picture. Thanks @Codder13 (#181, #193), reported in #180. ([fd28d018](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/fd28d018), [fbae4cf6](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/fbae4cf6), [8e8cf78a](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/8e8cf78a), [ba8e19a0](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/ba8e19a0), [797318d6](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/797318d6))
- **`omp` panes get a transcript.** Oh My Pi writes pi's own format, so `omp` is read as a second name for the pi journal, and `~/.omp/agent/sessions` joins `~/.pi/agent/sessions` as a default root. This touches every pi user: a machine with an `~/.omp` folder now has those sessions read too, and `COLLIE_PI_ROOT` still overrides both roots. Thanks @Codder13 (#181, #193), reported in #180. ([fd28d018](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/fd28d018), [fbae4cf6](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/fbae4cf6), [8e8cf78a](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/8e8cf78a), [ba8e19a0](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/ba8e19a0), [797318d6](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/797318d6))

### Changed

- **The group of machines is called a crew, and the word you type changed with it.** The command is `collie crew` and the web page is `/crew`, with the same verbs, arguments and exit codes as before; `collie pack` and `/pack` keep working and go away in 2.0.0. `collie pack` prints a one-line note on a terminal and nothing in a pipe: the note goes to stderr, so a script that reads status output on stdout sees exactly what it saw before. Nothing on the wire, in the env or on disk changes: the protocol paths, the headers, `COLLIE_PACK_*` and the state files keep their names, so a 1.6.0 member keeps talking to a 1.7.0 lead while you level them one at a time. The docs page moved from `collie docs pack` to `collie docs crew`, and the old name still prints it. A crew created without `--name` is now called "collie crew"; a crew you already have keeps the name it was given ([ADR 0038](./.adr/0038-the-group-is-a-crew-the-wire-keeps-pack.md)). ([15f1f987](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/15f1f987), [db6f9a5e](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/db6f9a5e))
- **The list of sessions on one machine now comes from the multiplexer you run, not from Herdr's layout.** The last switch in the bridge that read the multiplexer's name is gone. An adapter now declares whether this machine runs other instances of it and hands back the endpoint for each, and a multiplexer that keeps no such list refuses the question instead of being assumed to have nothing. Herdr declares it and still fronts every named session under your config root, exactly as before. tmux and zellij decline it, each for a reason written into the capability table: tmux has no command that lists servers and leaves a dead server's socket on disk, and zellij answers every read with a process rather than over a socket, so one Collie there drives the one session you pointed it at. `COLLIE_MULTI_SESSION` keeps its meaning as your own off switch. ([bd3adc5f](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/bd3adc5f))

### Fixed

- **The release page lists what changed, grouped, and drops GitHub's own list.** The update command still sits at the top, unfolded, and below it the page now prints the changelog's own lead sentences under Added, Changed, Fixed, Packaging and Docs, then the version's changelog section for the commits and a compare link against the previous tag. GitHub's generated list only knew merged pull requests, and most of Collie's history lands as direct commits, so it read as an almost empty release. ([fc98468b](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/fc98468b))
- **A missing protocol header means the lead learned nothing, not that the peer is foreign.** An answer with no `X-Pack-Protocol` header, from a proxy in front of a peer that is restarting, from a wrong path, or from a machine that is not in a crew at all, is now unreachable and keeps the normal dial cadence. The reason names the HTTP status and how long it has been saying nothing. Only a header that names another version, or a peer that refuses us for skew, is incompatible and goes on the thirty second, two minute, ten minute ladder. The rule is bounded in time, not in answers: a member that has been headerless for over a minute falls back onto that ladder, and any answer that names a version closes the window. ([90fc363a](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/90fc363a))
- **A crew update always ends.** While a run is levelling a peer, that peer is dialled on every sweep whatever backoff it is on, so a peer that answers three dials as incompatible no longer hides a run for ten minutes. A leg that has not changed state for twenty minutes fails, the run settles the moment every leg is terminal, and a run left behind by a crash is not resumed twenty minutes later. ([90fc363a](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/90fc363a))
- **A leg the wall clock failed stays failed.** The twenty minute clock reached the right verdict and the next sweep, one second later, wrote it straight back to waiting, because a leg is minted fresh from the member's own facts every sweep and those facts do not change when a clock runs out. The run was then queued again and could not end, which is the one thing this work is for. What clears the failure now is the member reaching the release, and nothing else. ([90fc363a](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/90fc363a))
- **A peer that speaks to its lead is dialled again at once.** Any request that passes the pack link's two factors clears the backoff the lead was holding against that machine, and the next sweep dials it. Bounded to one reset per member every ten seconds, and to five resets before the lead's own ladder stands again. ([90fc363a](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/90fc363a))
- **The update band asks for a reload with a reload mark.** Not with the up-arrow that means a new version is on offer, so a band that wants a tap no longer reads as a second update. A tap is also never swallowed by an automatic reload that already ran: the two share a guard against navigating twice, and a reload that does not actually leave the page gives the tap back three seconds later. ([90fc363a](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/90fc363a))
- **The update button on the Updates page holds one position.** The peer list and the preflight now open below it instead of above, so the button no longer moves 368 pixels down the screen when they arrive, and the confirm that replaces it stays inside a phone viewport. The button also stays disabled, and says it is checking, until the preflight has answered. ([90fc363a](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/90fc363a))
- **A peer's version on the Updates page refreshes on its own.** It refreshes after a crew update, with no pull to refresh. A run that levels only the peers writes no record on the lead, and the page used to drop that run entirely and stop asking for a fresh census. ([90fc363a](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/90fc363a))
- **A peer that will not level itself says why, on its own journal.** A peer decides eight times before it self-levels, and it used to decide in silence: the lead's leg then sat on "waiting" for the whole twenty minute wall clock and failed with a reason that named no cause. The peer now writes one line naming the guard that stopped it, and only while the lead's turn names that machine, so the line appears where an operator is asking why and not on every sweep of every day. Nothing new goes over the pack link. ([90fc363a](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/90fc363a))
- **The Updates page keeps up with a peer while you are looking at it.** The page reads the members' progress out of the answer it just polled, instead of out of a copy of an older run it fetched when it opened. The band would say a member could not be updated, or that another was still going, over a page that showed the run before it, until you reloaded. A peers-only retry now moves the rows within one poll, and the band and the page go quiet together. ([90fc363a](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/90fc363a))
- **The update band and the Updates page read one function.** They can no longer disagree about whether the crew is still moving. A peer that is still updating keeps the band up however long it takes, instead of going quiet after ten minutes over a page that was still counting. Past two minutes the band names the elapsed time and the page says no action is needed. A peer that could not be updated says so in one sentence on both, carries a Retry now button, and can be put down. ([90fc363a](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/90fc363a))
- **An update tapped on the phone reaches its runner.** On a linked-clone or a binary install the staging process handed the swap to a detached `systemd-run` and exited at once, and exiting killed the client before the user manager had started the runner, so the run record sat at `staging` for ten minutes with the lock held and the old version still serving. The handoff now waits for the manager to accept the job, for at most fifteen seconds, and prints "handed off" only after it has. A handoff the manager refused is an abort carrying the tier, the exit code or the word timeout and the manager's own first line, so the phone shows the failure within one poll and the retry is not refused. A launch tier with no manager to ask now declines to start from inside a service instead of dying mid-swap. A machine already stuck at `staging` is cleared by hand, and `docs/troubleshooting.md` carries the steps under "an update started from the phone stays at staging". ([c7191904](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/c7191904), [bd3adc5f](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/bd3adc5f))

- **A tab on zellij counts the panes you can reach, and a launcher beside a zellij pane runs.** Two things a zellij session showed for the first time when one was put under a lead. A tab's pane count came off zellij's own listing, which counts zellij's tab bar, status bar and any floating overlay, so a tab with two shells in it said three. And zellij reports no working directory for a pane, so a launcher row started beside one asked zellij to open a tab in a directory called nothing and zellij refused the whole launch. Counts are now counted off the panes Collie publishes, and a blank working directory means "wherever you would have opened it" on all three multiplexers rather than being passed down as a path. A launch onto a member no longer times out on the lead's poll budget either: a forwarded write gets its own 5 s deadline, so a launch that spawns a process on the far machine comes back as the tab it made instead of an outcome the phone could not confirm. ([bd3adc5f](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/bd3adc5f))

- **The all-sessions view follows the machine you are looking at.** `?all=1` widened the collie your phone is connected to, whatever host the page was scoped to, so the switch and the machine picker disagreed about which machine was on screen. They compose now: with a member selected the view widens that member. The lead also asks every member for all of its sessions on the sweep it already makes, and narrows the answer per request, so a pane in a member's second session is reachable at all, which it was not before. A member running one session sends and shows exactly what it sent and showed before, and nothing about the pack protocol version changes. ([bd3adc5f](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/bd3adc5f))

- **The skew warning names the remedy that matches the direction.** `collie crew status` told you to run `collie crew update <member>` for any version difference, including one where the lead was the older machine — and that command pushes the lead's build outwards, so it would have taken a newer member backwards. The line now says which side is behind: a member behind this lead gets the `crew update` it always got, a member ahead of it gets `collie update` here instead, and two different strings for the same version name no command at all. ([bd3adc5f](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/bd3adc5f))
- **The service check no longer calls a healthy systemd unsupervised.** `systemctl --user show-environment` needs `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` or `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`, and a Herdr plugin action passes neither, so `collie update --check` reported "no service manager on this host" on a machine where the bridge was running under `systemd --user` all along, and pushed the update handoff to a tier ADR 0037 refuses from inside a service. A failed probe now retries once with a derived `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, never overriding a value already set, and a container with no user manager still reads as unsupervised (reported by @lloydsilvertwo in #194). ([c7191904](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/c7191904), [bd3adc5f](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/bd3adc5f))
- **A binary install's restart recognises its own bridge across a version flip.** The pidfile guard compared the old bridge's command line with the path of the version now executing, and the two never agree after a flip, so the old process was never stopped, kept the port, and every update on an unsupervised binary install rolled back. The guard now ignores the version directory on both sides and still refuses a bridge from a different install root. Thanks @chernesk (#195). ([f3c3c22c](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/f3c3c22c), [9975839a](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/9975839a))

### Docs

- **A Herdr machine list is not a crew.** Herdr 0.9.0 keeps saved ssh machines in its own client, for its own window, on the machine you are sitting at. A crew runs Collie on every machine, reached from your phone through the lead, and handles uploads, the journal, the audit log, updates, and failover on each machine; it also runs under tmux and zellij, which keep no machine list. The two lists stay separate on purpose, and [ADR 0036](.adr/0036-the-map-of-machines-is-collies-a-mux-reports-one-machine.md) records why. [`docs/crew.md`](./docs/crew.md) compares them row by row, and `collie crew add` offers Herdr's machines as candidates so you never type a host twice. ([bd3adc5f](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/bd3adc5f))

## [1.6.0+collie.5] - 2026-09-08

### Changed

- **The pane header offers optional Zen mode.** Move the optional Zen mode button to the header before pane switching, keeping Settings in control of its visibility and removing the duplicate menu entry. ([7e38b24](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/7e38b24))

## [1.6.0+collie.4] - 2026-09-08

- Align the Simplified Chinese Composer Type button label with upstream v1.6.0. ([7815574](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/7815574))

## [1.6.0+collie.3] - 2026-09-08

- Compact the Composer control row with larger 20px icons and 12px labels, 44px tap targets, reduced outer spacing, and a shorter Display label with language-aware wrapping. ([86c8de2](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/86c8de2), [7a66691](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/7a66691))

## [1.6.0+collie.2] - 2026-09-08

- Restore the Cursor CLI brand icon from v0.36.1+collie.2, including Cursor label variants, using the current shared agent-icon styling. ([1706861](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/1706861))

## [1.6.0+collie.1] - 2026-09-08

- Merge upstream v1.6.0 (including v1.5.6): adopt its journal-backed full latest reply, notification setup recovery, auto-landscape zen and update handling; retain downstream input safeguards, notification cleanup, compact statusline and iOS viewport fixes. [Complete upstream changes and integration decisions](./docs/upstream-v1.6.0.md). ([3a4bca7](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/3a4bca7))

## [1.6.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- **mise installs Collie on Linux and macOS.** `mise use -g github:AltanS/collie@<version>` fetches the release tarball for that platform, and the install page documents it beside the Arch and Nix routes. mise owns updates on such a tree, with `mise upgrade --bump` and a `collie restart` to move the service off the old version directory, whether that service is a systemd unit or a launchd agent. `collie update` declines there without naming a package manager, because a mise tree is neither a checkout nor a packaged install, and the page says so. ([0febef5](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/0febef5), [0062b91](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/0062b91))
- **`collie doctor` and `collie update` find their tools on Windows.** The tool search finds `git`, `herdr`, `python3` and `bun`: it reads `PATH` with the Windows separator, tries the `PATHEXT` suffixes, and reads the variable under either spelling, so a Windows host no longer reports every tool as missing and the Updates page gets a real preflight. Windows stays a source-only platform that we do not test on hardware. The search can also find a `.cmd` or `.bat` shim that Collie then cannot start, because it spawns these tools without a shell, so a Windows host needs the `.exe` builds of `git`, `herdr`, `bun` and `python3` on `PATH`. Thanks to @jz-wilson (#175). ([d80ebbe](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d80ebbe), [daa5bdb](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/daa5bdb), [0062b91](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/0062b91))
- **A Claude pane is read only when its screen has changed.** A herd of idle agents no longer costs one socket read per pane per poll, because the pane is read for its session name only after a change. This uses Herdr's pane revision; tmux and zellij panes are read as before. Thanks to @sd2k (#189). ([198fe20](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/198fe20), [258341b](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/258341b))
- **Turning the phone to landscape opens zen.** Turning it back closes it, and a zen you opened yourself stays open through both. This works when zen is enabled. The switch sits under Zen in Settings, off until you turn it on, and it acts only while zen itself is on. Desktops and tablets are landscape all day and are not affected. Thanks @enieuwy (#182). ([36d7b97](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/36d7b97), [3e1033d](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/3e1033d), [5af27c9](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/5af27c9), [4bf3696](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/4bf3696))
- **A reply that scrolled off the terminal is shown in full.** The reply comes from the agent's own log, in place of the rows it covers, and Settings → View → Full latest reply turns it off. Thanks @sd2k (#185). ([46d2fe6](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/46d2fe6), [d433ce8](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d433ce8))
- **Collie recognises OMP's `rule` composer.** A phone reply reaches an OMP 18.1.10 pane configured with `composer.shape: rule` instead of stalling with "the message did not reach the input box". Thanks @taiansu (#160). ([72fbfec](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/72fbfec), [67b72e3](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/67b72e3))

### Fixed

- **Every command Collie prints for Herdr names its own plugin id.** This holds for every restart and update command, and names the plugin id of the instance that printed it. A host running a second Collie under `COLLIE_INSTANCE` used to be told to invoke `herdr.collie`, which is the host's first Collie and not the one asking, so following the line restarted the wrong service. ([68bb345](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/68bb345))
- **A binary replaced under the running service is noticed.** A package upgrade is caught even when the version does not move: `collie doctor` reports `restart-pending` against the executable itself and names `collie restart`, and the phone raises the same notice. `pacman` replaces the files and restarts nothing, and the check used to say something else did. ([4cb544e](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/4cb544e))
- **`collie pack update` on a packaged lead names the boundary.** It no longer reports a broken checkout. It used to fail with "is not a git checkout" about `/opt/collie`, which pacman owns and which carries no commit to push; it now says updates come from the package manager and sends the operator to the phone's Updates page, where the members still level to the version the lead is running. ([187a0dd](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/187a0dd))
- **`collie serve` stops when the tailnet has no HTTPS.** It says so instead of looking hung. Tailscale asks for HTTPS to be enabled and waits for the answer, and Collie captured that question until the command returned, which is the one case where it never does. Collie now reads the tailnet's certificate domains first and names the admin console, `collie doctor` reports the same tailnet, and the publish runs on the operator's own terminal so anything tailscale prints while it waits is visible. Thanks @nikolauska (#172). ([da8afeb](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/da8afeb))
- **Turning on notifications no longer sticks on "setting up".** A configuration read that fails leaves the switch retryable instead of disabling it, every service worker and PushManager wait is bounded at 30 seconds, registration goes through the shared API client so a sign-in redirect or a server error is reported beside the switch, and the phone reads as subscribed only after the bridge acknowledged the endpoint this device registered. Thanks @Shujakuinkuraudo (#178, #179). ([6fa2694](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/6fa2694))
- **`collie serve` says when it cannot read the HTTPS status.** It publishes anyway. A `tailscale status --json` this build cannot read means "can't tell", never "no HTTPS", so the refusal above stays off that path; the line names the admin console in case the publish does stop and wait after all. ([0062b91](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/0062b91))

### Packaging

- **`collie-bin` is not on the AUR yet.** The install page says so. The AUR has paused new account registration, so the Arch route is a clone of this repository and `makepkg -si` in `packaging/aur`, with the `paru -S collie-bin` line kept below it under "Once it is on the AUR". ([d7dd6d9](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d7dd6d9))
- **The Arch package installs to `/opt/collie`.** That is the layout Omarchy's package repository expects, and the package ships the metadata that repository uses to follow Collie's releases; a host under `/opt/collie` is told `sudo pacman -Syu collie-bin` like one under `/usr/lib/collie`. ([4480964](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/4480964))
- **The Arch package prints what to do next.** This covers installing, upgrading or removing it. pacman names `collie start` and the `COLLIE_MUX=herdr` form a host with two multiplexers needs, says the running service keeps the old build until `collie restart`, warns before a removal that the `systemd --user` unit and the tailscale serve mapping stay unless `collie uninstall` ran first, and afterwards names the directories left behind. Omarchy's repository carries the same file. ([187a0dd](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/187a0dd))
- **The Arch package trims `depends` and files its docs.** It no longer names `systemd` in `depends`, which is the init of every Arch and Omarchy host anyway, and it offers `herdr` and `tmux` as optional dependencies, one per multiplexer Collie can drive on such a host. `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/` now install to `/usr/share/doc/collie-bin/` and the licence to `/usr/share/licenses/collie-bin/`, instead of sitting in the install root where nothing reads them at run time. ([4480964](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/4480964))

### Docs

- **A packaged install can be linked into Herdr.** `herdr plugin link /opt/collie` registers Collie's action buttons there, and Herdr never finds the package on its own because it does not scan `/opt`. The install page used to say there is no `herdr plugin link` step at all, and the plugin's `update` and `update-major` actions declining on a packaged tree is the design, not a fault. ([e4e7e9f](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/e4e7e9f))

## [1.5.6] - 2026-09-07

- Collie carries its own package recipes: `packaging/aur` for Arch (`collie-bin`, not yet on the AUR) and `packages.<system>.collie` from this repository's flake for Nix. Both wrap the release tarball, neither builds anything, and neither updates itself, because the package manager owns that folder. ([bb46def](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/bb46def), [43a23a2](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/43a23a2))
- The flake's default package is Collie, so `nix run github:AltanS/collie` runs it. The pinned Bun the release is built with is still there, as `packages.<system>.bun`. ([43a23a2](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/43a23a2))
- The update band remembers a dismissal on the host instead of in one browser, the quiet pack notice can be put down on its own, and a host whose updates come from its package manager reads "Collie 1.6.0 available via pacman." instead of an offer to tap. ([23b5934](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/23b5934), [2be3547](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/2be3547), [f630c1c](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/f630c1c))
- A Mac or an arm64 Linux host on 1.5.4 or 1.5.5 gets a binary that starts again. A host whose binary will not start reinstalls with `curl -fsSL https://colliepwa.dev/install.sh | COLLIE_TAG=v1.5.6 sh`; a host still on 1.5.3 updates as usual, and linux-x64 was never affected. Those two releases were compiled on the build environment's patched Bun, so the Mac binary loaded ICU out of `/nix/store` and the arm64 Linux binary named a `/nix/store` program interpreter. The release now compiles on the upstream Bun archive the flake pins and refuses any binary whose loader inputs point outside the system's own library roots, thanks @rapporbit (#184). ([33df273](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/33df273), [9d07868](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/9d07868))
- The pack journal names each peer's leg change, each incompatible verdict with the reason and the backoff it earns, and the moment a run settles. A run that sits waiting on a peer is now read out of `journalctl --user -u collie` instead of inferred from the arithmetic. ([3ea0108](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/3ea0108))

## [1.5.5+collie.3] - 2026-09-07

- Normalize submitted Codex input to one continuous neutral rectangle across current and legacy ANSI palettes, preserving the diff-aligned equal gutters, explicit newlines, and text emphasis. ([13d4e21](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/13d4e21))

## [1.5.5+collie.2] - 2026-09-07

- Restore the v0.36.1+collie.2 seen-notification cleanup so handled conversations do not reappear in later alerts; extend it to peers, name summaries by conversation, and keep retraction updates silent without reviving dismissed notifications. ([6b62cfc](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/6b62cfc))

## [1.5.5+collie.1] - 2026-09-07

- Merge upstream v1.5.5: use its photo/file picker, anchored attach menu, guarded-submit prompt binding and inline Codex queue recognition; retain downstream multi-image safeguards, direct-input controls, statusline and iOS viewport fixes. [Complete upstream changes and integration decisions](./docs/upstream-v1.5.5.md). ([dbda134](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/dbda134))

## [1.5.5] - 2026-09-07

- The pack treats a packaged member as a quiet member instead of failing it, the phone says which host waits for its package manager, and a package swap under a running bridge asks for a restart. ([1df2451](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/1df2451))
- The attach button asks Photos or Files, so the camera roll is on offer again: one `accept` cannot carry `image/*` and thirty text extensions without a phone hiding the gallery. ([9fa55a7](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/9fa55a7))
- The attach button answers a tap at once, with a haptic tick and a filled tone, and its picker opens above the button rather than over it. A bottom sheet covered that button 42ms after the tap, so nothing drawn there to acknowledge the tap could be seen at all. ([9fa55a7](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/9fa55a7), [495b9c7](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/495b9c7))
- The Updates card holds its place while it checks and stays put for the whole run: the preflight and the peer lines arrive through a `Collapse`, the action button is disabled from the tap onward instead of vanishing, and it says what it is waiting for. ([689dcb2](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/689dcb2))
- Codex prints its queue hint and its context metric on one footer row while a turn is active, and the parser now knows that shape, so a reply there stops reporting that it never reached the input box, thanks @stekman08 (#176). ([0ad4f2f](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/0ad4f2f))
- The guarded submit is bound to the prompt the verifying read saw, so a dialog that takes focus between the typing and the Enter is refused instead of answered, thanks @stekman08 (#177). ([e7c1c78](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/e7c1c78))
- `Collapse` waits for a painted frame before it opens, so content that arrives late slides in instead of jumping. Every enter whose child mounted and opened together was a jump before this, which is every late arrival the primitive exists for. ([bffe062](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/bffe062))
- New `AnchoredMenu` primitive: a small menu that opens above its trigger instead of over it, for a control near the bottom edge that a bottom sheet would cover. ([ffd89b0](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/ffd89b0))

## [1.5.4+collie.2] - 2026-09-07

- Prevent iOS focus zoom when renaming a tab or pane by keeping the shared label input at 16px, without disabling pinch zoom or changing autofocus and save behavior. ([3c9a1fa](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/3c9a1fa))

## [1.5.4+collie.1] - 2026-09-07

- Merge upstream v1.5.4: text-file attachments and configurable upload limits, package-managed installs, update/Bun discovery fixes and pinned build tools; use upstream's copyable header error details while retaining downstream composer and statusline behavior. ([886c8e3](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/886c8e3))

## [1.5.3+collie.2] - 2026-09-06

- Color Codex context rings and percentages by remaining capacity (green above 30%, yellow above 10%, red at 10% or less), and distinguish Fast OFF/ON with hollow/filled lightning while preserving other TUI field colors. ([c86e76a](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/c86e76a))

## [1.5.3+collie.1] - 2026-09-06

- Restore upstream Codex line wrapping for answers, submitted input, diffs and recap; remove local row-joining and soft-break heuristics while retaining message surfaces and send safeguards. ([d4c3cba](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/d4c3cba))

- Let pane errors open full, selectable details without expanding the header, and distinguish unverified terminal input from undelivered text. ([4af0d60](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/4af0d60))

- Merge upstream v1.5.3: keep release checks and tag fetches on HTTPS despite Git SSH rewrite rules, thanks @magoz (#170). ([d5d033f](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/d5d033f))

## [1.5.2+collie.1] - 2026-09-06

- Keep statusline visible while typing, allow horizontal overflow scrolling, and place multi-host send targets at the start of the same row. ([7ca2f75](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/7ca2f75))

- Recognize Codex working-turn composers and wrapped image paths without weakening send verification; wrap terminal tokens at punctuation while preserving text and search offsets. ([a0f7bd6](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/a0f7bd6))
- Draw context rings with a clockwise used segment and a remaining hollow segment, keeping percentages and accessible semantics without extra visible labels. ([9f6e574](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/9f6e574))
- Hide dev and dirty markers in human-facing version labels while preserving internal build identity and cache update checks. ([3e3d28b](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/3e3d28b))
- Merge upstream v1.5.2: adopt shared labelled-rule clipping, bounded STT cancellation, Traditional Chinese and wider desktop panes; retain downstream composer, input verification, terminal surfaces and statusline behavior. ([ebab2de](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/ebab2de))

## [1.5.1+collie.15] - 2026-09-06

- Show explicit Codex context remaining/used labels with proportional rings and usage-based warning colors; animate working hourglasses with reduced-motion support and vertically align compact statusline fields. ([0cef8e7](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/0cef8e7))

## [1.5.1+collie.14] - 2026-09-06

- Reclaim unused mobile space by applying the top safe-area inset once across connection/update banners and the header, trimming Codex's removed-composer spacer rows, and reducing the terminal tail padding to 4px without changing the bottom safe area. ([cf19b26](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/cf19b26))

## [1.5.1+collie.13] - 2026-09-05

- Emphasize every line of submitted Codex input with semibold text on the existing gray surface; cover mixed Chinese/English terminal wraps and preserve explicit line breaks, image separators, links, and answer/diff styling. ([51dcf42](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/51dcf42))

## [1.5.1+collie.12] - 2026-09-05

- Make direct-input keys easier to identify with compact icon-and-name legends, a standard Escape symbol, bolder direction arrows, and labeled Fn/navigation switching without changing key sizes or input behavior. ([b077934](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/b077934))

## [1.5.1+collie.11] - 2026-09-05

- Merge Keys into direct input with the v0.36.1+collie.2 navigation/function keyboard, modifier locks and arrow repeat; keep activation keyboard-free and arrange all four Composer controls as equal-width icon-and-text buttons without changing the bottom safe area. ([92eab3f](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/92eab3f))

## [1.5.1+collie.10] - 2026-09-05

- Move pane switching into a header icon, remove the bottom handle and Agent status band, and show the send target below the statusline only for multi-host panes, including while typing. ([20213e4](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/20213e4))

## [1.5.1+collie.9] - 2026-09-05

- Compact Codex statusline fields into icons and values, preserving ANSI colors, full labels, and access to long rows without changing composer behavior. ([a79e7f9](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/a79e7f9))

## [1.5.1+collie.8] - 2026-09-05

- Add Geist to the interface typeface picker and Geist Mono to terminal fonts as self-hosted, offline-cached web fonts, keeping both preferences independent and existing defaults unchanged. ([8c5a0ef](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/8c5a0ef))

## [1.5.1+collie.7] - 2026-09-05

- Rejoin Codex diff continuations before mobile wrapping so words and links stay intact, preserving source newlines, indentation, highlights and continuous row backgrounds. ([a435dc2](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/a435dc2))

## [1.5.1+collie.6] - 2026-09-05

- Recognize empty paragraphs inside the active Codex composer, fixing stalled image, mixed-media and text sends while keeping submitted echoes, dialog boundaries and the bounded Enter-verification guard protected. ([ed3857d](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/ed3857d))

## [1.5.1+collie.5] - 2026-09-05

- Paint Codex diff and submitted-message backgrounds as continuous full-width rectangles with balanced gutters, retaining inline diff highlights and a subtle gray message surface in both themes. ([b3fefe3](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/b3fefe3))
- Reflow terminal-width wraps in submitted Codex messages independently of answer prose, preserving explicit short lines, paragraphs, image markers, code and table structure, and wrapped paths. ([7ffe80e](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/7ffe80e))

## [1.5.1+collie.4] - 2026-09-05

- Reflow Codex Conversation recap paragraphs as well as regular answers, fixing terminal-wrap fragments while preserving recap separators, structured output, and the Wrap toggle. ([a0ccb07](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/a0ccb07))

## [1.5.1+collie.3] - 2026-09-05

- Verify Codex image placeholders for single images, multiple images, and interleaved captions; preserve upstream text/paste guards and require a fresh empty input before image-only submission. ([edd08e6](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/edd08e6))

## [1.5.1+collie.2] - 2026-09-05

- Reflow Codex answer prose at the phone width instead of retaining host-terminal wraps, preserving paragraph breaks, structured output, ANSI styling, and upstream display handling. ([d0bce86](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/d0bce86))

## [1.5.1+collie.1] - 2026-09-05

- Remove repository GitHub Actions workflows; downstream versions are distributed as tags without GitHub Releases. ([5717518](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/5717518))
- Remove previously published GitHub Releases and their attached binaries while retaining version tags. ([5717518](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/5717518))
- Track upstream v1.5.1 and restore its behavior except for the full-height iPhone viewport and compact composer bottom clearance. ([7abcbab](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/7abcbab))

## [1.5.0+collie.7] - 2026-09-05

### Fixed

- Use the large viewport height for the locked document root to prevent a status-bar-sized bottom gap in iPhone standalone PWAs. ([83f22a6](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/83f22a6))

## [1.5.0+collie.6] - 2026-09-05

### Fixed

- Corrected the tag-only workflow filter to use valid GitHub glob syntax. ([be0b24c](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/be0b24c))

## [1.5.0+collie.5] - 2026-09-05

### Fixed

- Anchored the app to the live visual viewport and locked document scrolling; removed composer safe-area margin compensation that left intermittent bottom gaps on iOS. ([983b86a](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/983b86a))
- Excluded downstream `+collie.x` tags from automatic GitHub Release publishing. ([983b86a](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/983b86a))

## [1.5.0+collie.4] - 2026-09-05

### Fixed

- Kept the iOS composer safe-area compensation on the `Collapse` content box so dismissing the keyboard cannot leave a reproducible blank row beneath the reply field. ([002a4bc](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/002a4bc))

## [1.5.0+collie.3] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- Removed the standalone pane-switch grip and its entire layout row; **Switch pane** now lives in the pane actions sheet, leaving the composer directly below the agent statusline. ([aedc311](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/aedc311))
- Reclaimed the resting iOS bottom inset around the composer so its controls occupy the safe area instead of leaving an empty strip below; keyboard-open layout keeps the uncompensated inset behavior. ([aedc311](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/aedc311))

## [1.5.0+collie.2] - 2026-09-04

### Changed

- Compressed Codex statusline state, context, speed, approval, task, and goal fields into accessible icons. ([e80a2f6](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/e80a2f6))

## [1.5.0+collie.1] - 2026-09-04

### Changed

- **Integrated upstream 1.5.0** (which includes 1.4.0 and 1.4.1): operator launchers from `launchers.toml`, phone-driven updates (the `/settings/updates` page, one update band, pack-wide sequencing behind health gates and rollback), tables in the mirror that pan as one unit, and the Codex mobile row fixes (#144).

### Fixed

- The downstream Codex labelled-separator and iOS safe-area fixes were dropped in favour of upstream's implementations; the fork's Codex image and slash-command send verification, answer reflow and status-strip compaction remain on the v1.5.0 codebase.
## [1.5.2] - 2026-09-05

- STT releases its admission slot immediately when a recording is cancelled, thanks @en-ver (#163). ([43c9cfe](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/43c9cfe))
- Labelled terminal rules now fit on a single line across all harnesses, and only the rule glyphs are dimmed, thanks @en-ver (#168). ([d980f37](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d980f37))
- Collie speaks Traditional Chinese, thanks @lekoOwO (#165). ([1cec9ea](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/1cec9ea))
- The pane and history screens now widen with the window on a desktop, up to 1400px, so a wide terminal mirror stops wrapping (#166). ([3870c1c](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/3870c1c))

## [1.5.1] - 2026-09-04

- Docs carry phone screenshots of the update flow. ([23dfb1a](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/23dfb1a))
- The refusal and `collie doctor` now spell the fix as `COLLIE_MUX=<mux> collie start`, and name the file it lands in. ([1d458f6](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/1d458f6))
- `COLLIE_MUX=tmux collie start` now writes the choice to `.env`, so the next plain `start` and the supervised unit both see it. ([1d458f6](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/1d458f6))
- The installed app no longer locks to portrait, so a tablet can run Collie in landscape, thanks @edwinhu (#162); the pane and history screens sit in a centred column above phone width, like every other screen. ([28255ae](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/28255ae))
- Release pages link to the version's changelog section instead of copying it, and carry GitHub's generated list of pull requests, contributors and the compare link. ([cd6feaa](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/cd6feaa))
- `collie pair` prints a QR code beside the code; scanning it opens Settings on the phone with the code filled in. ([8c516b4](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/8c516b4))

## [1.5.0] - 2026-09-04

- Pane detail: dragging the status line strip above the switcher handle no longer scrolls the composer out of view. ([7b77d7c](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/7b77d7c))
- Tapping a push notification opens the app again on Android; the tap no longer waits on a discarded tab before it may open a window (regression since 1.2.0). ([ecee7c2](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/ecee7c2))
- Updates page at `/settings/updates`: the check, the update card, a read-only line per pack member, and one action button. ([9ab65bc](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/9ab65bc))
- Settings keeps one "Updates" row with a status line and a chevron; the footer update chip and the update card left the page. ([9ab65bc](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/9ab65bc))
- An update push now opens the Updates page. The wire value is unchanged, so an old service worker still lands on Settings. ([9ab65bc](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/9ab65bc))
- Every pack member reports its own update preflight over the link, and `GET /api/update/check` answers with a dated `pack` row per member. ([4667c8a](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/4667c8a))
- `collie pack update` prints each member's peer-reported verdict beside its SSH one and names a disagreement. ([9913b5a](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/9913b5a))
- `collie update --to-tag v<x.y.z>` pins an update to one exact release; it refuses a prerelease, a downgrade and a major crossing. Plumbing, not an operator verb. ([7c42d2f](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/7c42d2f))
- One top-of-app update band, replacing the self-update row: release on offer, confirm just tapped, run in flight, new bridge, and peers following. ([ff4bf25](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/ff4bf25))
- A peer follows its lead: it levels itself to the release its lead is running, taking the exact tag from GitHub over anonymous HTTPS, behind its own preflight, health gate and rollback. The lead grants one turn at a time and states nothing while it is mid-run. ([0f8c337](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/0f8c337))
- The Updates page and the band report each peer's leg of a pack-wide run: waiting, updating, updated, rolled back or unreachable. ([07d305e](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/07d305e))
- `POST /api/update` accepts `peersOnly: true`, the Updates page's "Retry pack update": a new run whose only legs are the peers. ([bbfa7c1](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/bbfa7c1))
- Known gap: a lead rolled back by hand after its peers have levelled leaves them ahead of it. No peer is ever stepped down over the pack link; the remedy is `collie pack update <member>` from the lead. ([f61a246](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/f61a246))
- The snapshot and `GET /api/update/check` compose the update status from one place, so the band and the Updates page can never disagree about a run. ([dcaa51d](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/dcaa51d))
- One confirm on the phone updates a whole pack: the lead first under its own health gate, then each peer, one at a time. ([e4d12af](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/e4d12af))
- Every pack member reports its running version on the sweep, so the lead no longer shows a peer's version as blank and a peer that finished updating is marked done and hands on its turn. ([94308d9](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/94308d9))

## [1.4.1] - 2026-09-03

- Update card says "Up to date. Nothing to do." at the top and folds the preflight details unless a check is red or an update is available. ([235ab1b](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/235ab1b))
- The phone's update preflight checks this instance only (`update --check --local`), so an unreachable pack peer no longer turns the lead's card red. ([fd4be21](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/fd4be21))
- The preflight lists release tags over anonymous HTTPS when `origin` is a GitHub SSH URL, and quotes git's own error, so a missing SSH agent no longer reads as a dead remote. ([fd4be21](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/fd4be21))
- The update card no longer says "the newest release isn't known yet" right after a restart, its first read now waits briefly for the delayed startup poll instead of answering with a stale null. ([203dd07](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/203dd07))

## [1.4.0] - 2026-09-03

- Operator launchers: your own commands, declared in `launchers.toml`, tapped to start. They live on the dashboard and in the "Switch pane" sheet, not in a pane or Space header. (#125) ([12dd5e8](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/12dd5e8))
- Update notifications are a digest: at most one push a day, naming every release it folded, never before 09:00. A patch-only delta rides a weekly digest instead, or a minor that arrives first. ([f05b4de](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/f05b4de))
- `POST /api/update/snooze` dismisses the current update digest until a newer release and a fresh window. ([f05b4de](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/f05b4de))
- `pack update --path '~/…'` expands the tilde on the remote's own `$HOME`, not this machine's. ([f05b4de](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/f05b4de))
- `pack update --host` remembers the ssh route as soon as the probe proves it, not only after a
  fully successful run. ([f05b4de](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/f05b4de))
- `collie update --check [--json]`, a read-only preflight over doctor, disk, bun, the tracked-file tree, upstream and the service unit, plus every pack member on a lead. ([8c9e5d4](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/8c9e5d4))
- A linked checkout updates by staging: `collie update` builds a release into a `versions/vX.Y.Z` git worktree and flips the `current` symlink, so a failed build never touches the running install and `collie update --rollback` works on a checkout (ADR 0006, amended) ([7845c87](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/7845c87))
- `bun run test` no longer exits 0 when a test fails: a probe script called process.exit on import. ([b2a86cf](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/b2a86cf))
- `collie update` stages, then hands the swap to a detached updater: it flips `current`, restarts, polls `/api/health` for 30 s (`COLLIE_UPDATE_HEALTH_TIMEOUT_MS`), and rolls back once by itself if the new version does not answer. Watch it with `collie update --status`. ([d569ffc](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d569ffc))
- `collie pack update` is one sequence: preflight every machine, update the lead first, then each peer in turn, health-gated. The first failure stops the run and leaves the rest untouched, with the recovery command named. ([fa57012](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/fa57012))
- Update Collie from the phone: a settings card with the version, the newest release, the preflight per check and its state, behind `POST /api/update`: same gate as a send, one confirm, and its own confirm for a major. ([3f4caf9](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/3f4caf9))
- `collie update --check` no longer turns red, and the phone's Update button no longer disables, on a lead whose peer has no ssh record: that fact still shows red on the member, but updating the lead needs no route to a peer, so the top verdict is amber. ([08c0b0b](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/08c0b0b))
- A table in the mirror pans in its own scroller while the prose around it keeps wrapping, so Wrap no longer has to be turned off to read one. A box-drawn table pans as one unit; a framed row outside a table still does not wrap. (#5, #158) ([8d079ff](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/8d079ff))
- Codex on a phone: submitted-message rows no longer render as solid black bars in the light theme, and a labelled `─ Worked for … ───` separator stays on one line. (#144) ([0104d27](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/0104d27))
- A launcher's `cwd` is optional: pin one and it wins everywhere, leave it out and it means "here", your home dir from the dashboard, that pane's own folder from the switcher. ([7efad18](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/7efad18))
- Tapped from a pane, a launcher opens a tab beside it instead of a new Space; tapped from the dashboard, a Space, as before. ([7efad18](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/7efad18))
- Launcher rows read live per host, so on a pack they come from the machine whose row you tapped, never the lead's own file. ([7efad18](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/7efad18))
- The new-tab and new-Space controls show a spinner and ignore a second tap while the create is in flight; the pane list catches up within a poll burst after any create or close. ([d03ccd7](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d03ccd7))
- The "Switch pane" sheet rises from its handle and follows the thumb as you drag, instead of appearing at the screen's bottom edge only on release, and it opens with a haptic tick. ([5bfa631](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/5bfa631))
- On the pane screen a status now shows in the header title instead of floating over the tab strip's own controls. ([5bfa631](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/5bfa631))

## [1.3.0+collie.1] - 2026-09-03

### Changed

- **Integrated upstream 1.3.0.** This adds activity-following mirror polling, keeps boxed TUI rows
  on one line on a narrow mirror, treats a scroll arriving with a changed container height as
  layout, and serializes pairing registry writes.

### Fixed

- Retained the downstream Codex image and slash-command send verification, narrow-screen output
  cleanup, and iOS safe-area layout on the v1.3.0 codebase.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-03

- Mirror no longer freezes when the soft keyboard or Keys dock shrinks the pane: a scroll that arrives with a changed container height is layout, not the user leaving the bottom (#155) ([1862276](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/1862276))
- Boxed TUI rows (a `/model` picker, a panel border) stay on one line on a narrow phone mirror instead of wrapping into a scrambled frame; `tree` output and prose still wrap, thanks @alexlee2046 (#156) ([d7a4276](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d7a4276))
- Releases publish a linux-arm64 build, so a Raspberry Pi installs instead of 404ing; the from-source docs call the bootstrap script with bash, which it is (#157) ([64c7d7e](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/64c7d7e))
- Mirror polling follows what you do: 300ms bursts after a key or a message while the screen keeps changing, 1.5s while you follow a working agent, 4s on the home screen while an agent works, 6s when nothing says you are watching (#156) ([d2cb8a3](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d2cb8a3))
- Pairing no longer logs `could not stamp lastSeenAt: ENOENT` once a minute: concurrent stamps from one poll tick raced on a shared temp file; writes are serialized and temp names are unique now (#159) ([d4bd3f9](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d4bd3f9))

## [1.2.0+collie.3] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed

- The pane composer now stays docked to the viewport bottom across iOS safe-area changes. ([767fa25](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/767fa25))

## [1.2.0+collie.2] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed

- The pane input now moves into the iOS bottom safe area instead of reserving it as a blank strip. ([a8575da](https://github.com/zhdsmy/collie/commit/a8575da))

## [1.2.0+collie.1] - 2026-09-02

### Changed

- **Integrated upstream 1.2.0.** This adds dual-container speech-to-text probes, compact dashboard
  rows, reliable Android notification deep links and assets, and expanded OMP recognition.

### Fixed

- Retained the downstream Codex image and slash-command send verification, narrow-screen output
  cleanup, and iOS safe-area layout on the v1.2.0 codebase.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-02

- oh-my-pi panes show omp's own π mark, painted with its official three-stop gradient, instead of the initials tile; the brand table now says every mark must be painted, thanks @enieuwy (#151) ([17386ef](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/17386ef))
- The OMP adapter recognises the open-ended `╰─ <draft>` composer row and standalone status row that OMP 18.1.2 paints on a wide pane; the closed OMP 17 box and the corner-to-corner modal rule are unchanged, thanks @ImArtisann (#149, #150) ([6081520](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/6081520))
- A notification tap on Android opens the deep-linked pane again when the Collie tab had been discarded; navigate before focus, and fall through to a new window when no tab survives. (#147) ([18cd9cb](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/18cd9cb))
- A functional commit now records one line under `## [Unreleased]` instead of bumping the version; the pre-commit hook enforces both halves, and only the `chore(release):` commit bumps and dates the heading. ([f6805cb](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/f6805cb))
- `collie stt test` now sends the two containers a phone actually records, webm/opus and mp4, after the wav probe, and fails with guidance when the provider refuses one; Voxtral on OpenRouter refuses both, whisper-large-v3-turbo accepts them (#148) ([d6d7a1c](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d6d7a1c))
- A refused transcription names the upstream status and the container it was sent as, so the phone's error says which format the provider rejected (#148) ([d6d7a1c](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d6d7a1c))
- The mirror's default font size is 10px, down from 12; a device that already picked a size keeps it ([4b005aa](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/4b005aa))
- Android push notifications show a proper small badge glyph and a full-size Collie mark; the maskable home-screen tile was doing both jobs and rendered as a grey block on the notification ([177a8a9](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/177a8a9))
- Renaming a tab or pane from its sheet works on the phone again; the rename field's own keyboard used to fold the strip band and unmount the sheet mid-edit ([93373ce](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/93373ce))
- Dashboard rows lead with the pane title beside a small agent tile, with the space and tab as the address beneath; the big tile, the bold space name and its truncation are gone ([c442429](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/c442429))

## [1.1.0+collie.4] - 2026-09-02

### Fixed

- Codex image replies submit after upload paths become `[Image #N]`; stale tokens remain blocked. (55a7b45)

## [1.1.0+collie.3] - 2026-09-02

### Fixed

- Codex answers no longer retain host-terminal hard wraps, including broken CJK continuations.
- Codex `Worked for` and `Conversation recap` separators stay on one row without trailing rule remnants.
- Codex status lines use compact context, fast-mode, approval, and goal labels on narrow screens.
- The composer paints and occupies the iOS bottom safe area consistently across keyboard viewport transitions.

## [1.1.0+collie.2] - 2026-09-02

### Fixed

- Codex slash commands submit reliably while autocomplete temporarily replaces the status row.

## [1.1.0+collie.1] - 2026-09-02

### Changed

- **Integrated upstream 1.1.0.** This includes pack host targeting and colour, the paired-device
  path from read-only mode, pack warrant hardening, the Claude slash-autocomplete parser fix, and
  upstream's removal of redundant pull-to-refresh.

### Added

- Web Push content follows each subscribed device's UI language.
- Cursor keeps its official agent mark wherever Collie identifies the active agent.

### Fixed

- Direct typing arms without focusing the hidden input or opening the phone keyboard.
- Codex `Conversation recap` stays on one separator row on narrow screens.
- The current v1 composer chrome extends into the iOS bottom safe area, with the compact pane
  switcher handle retained.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-01

- The "Side by side" instructions moved out of `docs/upgrading.md` into their own `docs/deployment.md` section. ([0231500](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/0231500))
- The read-only strip links to Settings → Paired devices. ([defec91](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/defec91))
- Per-host colour on the server glyph in pack mode, ten stable hues. ([e3db22d](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/e3db22d))
- Pull-to-refresh; polling already keeps the view fresh. ([86e8d78](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/86e8d78))
- The new-space sheet picks the host in pack mode; unreachable or incompatible members are shown but disabled. ([af22f6d](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/af22f6d))
- **Claude's slash-command autocomplete no longer hides the input box.** The completion list is taller than the statusline window the chrome walk allows, so the box went undetected: the pane fell back to the raw mirror and every send stalled with "Message didn't reach the input box". The popup is now read as its own block and rendered as a list. ([c265d3e](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/c265d3e))

## [1.0.0+collie.4] - 2026-09-02

### Fixed

- **The pane composer now actually occupies the iOS bottom safe area.** The compensation is applied
  to `Collapse`'s direct content box so Safari paints and positions the full chrome below the normal
  viewport edge; applying it to the outer grid/flex item in `1.0.0+collie.3` still left the controls
  above the visible empty strip on iPhone.

## [1.0.0+collie.3] - 2026-09-02

### Fixed

- **The iOS safe-area compensation now applies to the pane's actual bottom flex row.** The v1
  `Collapse` wrapper made the composer-local margin in `1.0.0+collie.2` ineffective at moving the
  dock; the outer row now reclaims that height while the current chrome still paints through it.

## [1.0.0+collie.2] - 2026-09-02

### Fixed

- **The mobile composer reclaims iOS safe-area height without exposing the page background.** The
  compensated padding and margin geometry from `v0.36.1+collie.2` now fits the current full-width
  chrome dock, keeping controls close to the Home Indicator while chrome still paints through the
  inset.

## [1.0.0+collie.1] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed

- **Codex no longer leaves a painted blank composer row in the mobile mirror.**
- **The pane switcher uses a compact chevron instead of a Home Indicator-like grip.**
- **The composer no longer adds redundant padding beyond the iOS safe area.**

## [1.0.2] - 2026-09-01

- `docs/deployment.md` ends with one footer instead of two. A plain-text `← back to the README` line sat above the real link, and the site footer strip matches only the link, leaving the plain line as a dangling sentence. ([e880281](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/e880281))
- **The working status dot no longer pings; it breathes.** It uses a 2.4 s opacity cycle without a ring or scaling, applied only to the pane chip and the pane header. The dot stays static on the tab, space, card and overview chips, where several at once would read as a strobe rather than as "alive". `prefers-reduced-motion` still disables it. ([a2ee186](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/a2ee186))
- **A lead is no longer deposed by unprovable claims.** At boot, only a warrant signed and verified by this lead can depose it. If a peer reports a higher warrant generation or refuses with no warrant, the lead logs the event once and ignores it. Stale fields from an old pack no longer take down the new lead's front door. ([bd7e3b5](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/bd7e3b5))
- `collie pack leave` clears the deputy designation, warrant, standby roster, and `standby-devices.json`, preventing old pack state from leaking into the next pack. ([bd7e3b5](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/bd7e3b5))
- `collie pack remove <member>` drops the deputy designation if it names that member, keeping `pack status` and `pack deputy --revoke` in agreement. ([bd7e3b5](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/bd7e3b5))
- Stored warrants stamped with another pack's id are discarded at boot, logging the source pack name. ([bd7e3b5](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/bd7e3b5))

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-01

- **`collie pack join bluefin` works in a terminal**: an address without a scheme or port uses port 8787, the command prompts for the token, and a lead answering over plain HTTP requests confirmation instead of requiring `--insecure` ([6e3dfca](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/6e3dfca))
- `collie pack invite` prints the short join command first, followed by the stdin form for scripts ([6e3dfca](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/6e3dfca))
- `--label` defaults to the local hostname, so a joining peer uses its host name instead of `collie-8f3a2b1c` ([6e3dfca](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/6e3dfca))
- `collie pack join` and `collie pack leave` are the canonical commands; `collie join` and `collie leave` remain as aliases ([6e3dfca](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/6e3dfca))
- **The install and update docs lead with the two shapes an install actually has**, and neither assumes a bare `collie` on your PATH: a Herdr-managed install spells every verb as a plugin action, a standalone one as `bin/collie <verb>`. `docs/install.md` is two ways in rather than four, and ends with the update command it never carried; `docs/upgrading.md` opens on the update instead of the uninstall, folds the two 0.x sections into one crossing, and drops the finished v1 beta train.
- **`DEPLOYMENT.md` is now [`docs/deployment.md`](./docs/deployment.md), and colliepwa.dev publishes it.** The site serves the files the README's documentation table lists, so every link to a front door other than the default used to leave the site. Each variant keeps its anchor; in-code pointers name the new path, including the `COLLIE_SKIP_SERVE` warning and `collie doctor`'s serve finding.
- The post-update hooks nudge swallows a spawn failure of the new binary (ENOEXEC/EACCES) instead of failing an update that already succeeded — the silence its own comment promised.
- `collie restart` decides the multiplexer before it stops the bridge, so a refusal no longer leaves the bridge down.
- The refusal lists each multiplexer on its own line, points at the one the environment already names, and prints the exact line to append.
- `collie join` with only a lead address says that the token is missing and shows how to pass it, instead of a bare usage line.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-01

**This release is the whole `1.0.0-alpha` / `1.0.0-beta` line in one entry**, grouped once; the
per-release detail lives in the linked commits and the git history. Coming from 0.x, read
[`docs/upgrading.md`](./docs/upgrading.md) → *Upgrading from 0.x to 1.0* first.

**Upgrading, in one line each.** From the Herdr plugin:
`herdr plugin action invoke update-major --plugin herdr.collie`. From a checkout you can reach:
`bin/collie update --major`. Fresh install: `curl -fsSL https://colliepwa.dev/install.sh | sh`.
Neither upgrade path assumes a `collie` on your PATH. Details and rollback:
[`docs/upgrading.md`](./docs/upgrading.md).

- **A pack brings several machines to one phone.** A lead merges its peers' spaces, tabs and panes and proxies every read and write byte for byte; `collie pack invite | join | add | update | leave | status | rotate | remove | promote | reconnect | set-address` are the verbs ([9f5d91e](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/9f5d91e), [c5a810f](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/c5a810f))
- **A lead is demoted only against a live approval minted on itself: `collie pack approve-promote <member>`.** Ten minutes, single use, `--cancel`, fingerprint-bound; `pack rotate` still has no grace window and now warns that it has none ([5667c8f](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/5667c8f))
- **`scripts/collie-ctl.sh` is a bootstrap shim and nothing else.** Every verb is spelled `bin/collie <verb>` and the shim no longer sources `.env`, so a `BUN_INSTALL` set only there must move to the environment ([cfc09d5](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/cfc09d5))
- **`collie doctor` — one read-only pass over the traps that fail silently.** Bind, ACL, front door, `web/dist`, the multiplexer, the beacon hooks and pack health, each finding naming the verb that fixes it, warnings exiting 0 and `--json` making the report scriptable ([8590086](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/8590086), [3e5b4c1](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/3e5b4c1))
- **Device pairing.** `collie pair` mints a one-time code the phone spends for a bearer token, every write needs that token while any device is paired, and `collie devices list | revoke <label>` are the other half ([506be94](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/506be94))
- **Collie drives tmux and zellij, not only Herdr.** `COLLIE_MUX=tmux` or `COLLIE_MUX=zellij` picks the multiplexer behind one Collie-owned port, where each adapter declares its capabilities and the UI reads them from `GET /api/config` rather than from a name ([2feb1aa](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/2feb1aa), [4d6787f](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/4d6787f))
- **A peer's panes render on the phone again.** The lead no longer re-declares `Content-Encoding: gzip` over a body Bun already decompressed; the saving came back as a transform on the lead→phone hop ([9a17dda](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/9a17dda))
- **Agents name themselves through their own hooks.** `collie hooks install claude` writes the guarded Claude emitter and `collie beacon emit` gives a pane its agent's name, status and session ref ([b17e8c5](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/b17e8c5), [cb7eb7b](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/cb7eb7b))
- **A deputy takes over when the lead goes dark, on the operator's tap.** `collie pack deputy <member>` mints a signed, generational warrant and arms a standby door on `COLLIE_STANDBY_PORT`; there is no automatic election ([86c4510](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/86c4510), [a696e94](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/a696e94))
- **`url`, `status`, `serve` and `qr` defer to `COLLIE_PUBLIC_URL`** wherever it is set, instead of printing the bare tailnet name (#122) ([d1e671e](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d1e671e))
- **Voice input — a microphone in the composer, and hands-free.** Off until `collie stt setup`, round-tripped by `collie stt test | status | off`, served by the `openai-compatible` or `codex` provider, with `--lang` / `COLLIE_STT_LANG` for the spoken language ([14575b3](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/14575b3), [ca5564a](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/ca5564a))
- **The loopback gates fail closed.** Host validation is on, `COLLIE_TRUSTED_USER` rejects an absent login as well as a wrong one, a non-loopback bind refuses to start behind the opt-outs `COLLIE_ALLOW_ANY_HOST=1`, `COLLIE_TRUSTED_USER_OPTIONAL=1` and `COLLIE_ALLOW_NON_LOOPBACK_BIND=1`, uploads are typed by magic bytes, and `.env` is held to owner-only and announces every variable it shadows ([b0f6711](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/b0f6711), [d941de1](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d941de1))
- **Collie's UI in six languages.** English, Deutsch, Español, 한국어, 日本語 and 中文, picked in Settings per device from a typed dictionary, with every bridge refusal carrying a stable `code` and named `detail` ([42949cf](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/42949cf))
- **A pack overview page at `/pack`.** One read-only card per machine — health, version, secret pickup, deputy — fed by `GET /api/pack` and hidden unless this collie is in a pack ([0634d4b](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/0634d4b))
- **A new mark and a new icon family, and they move.** The mark drifts at rest and turns one full round whenever the app has something to tell you, `prefers-reduced-motion` stops it, the favicons and tiles were redrawn to match — the 16px tab favicon refilled and its eye held open, so it no longer reads as a horse — and every mutating call must name the channel that acknowledges it (`lib/ack-manifest.ts`) ([526c313](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/526c313), [e0aeb7b](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/e0aeb7b), [1b248af](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/1b248af), [b836958](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/b836958))
- **Zen mode, and chrome that gets out of the way.** Settings → Zen mode takes every Collie surface off the screen and leaves the mirror alone, and short of that a chevron folds the tab and pane strips into one 24px bar of beads (#139 — thanks @abosnjakovic) ([a8bf60a](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/a8bf60a), [f60d009](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/f60d009))
- **Four agent-parser fixes carried over from the 0.x line.** Codex's one-dim-segment status row, a Codex draft wrapped onto an indented line, oh-my-posh 18's ghost suggestion read as your text, and the Windows bridge now running under `conhost.exe --headless` ([c6ba534](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/c6ba534), [89cbbe0](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/89cbbe0), [d4a9030](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d4a9030), [baf04ac](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/baf04ac))
- **Work you used to walk back to the desk for.** Worktrees created through the multiplexer (#135 — thanks @broven), "All sessions" as one triage list, "Show in terminal" on your tap, and `quick-replies.toml` for your own Quick dock (#131 — thanks @fucx) ([50e0e42](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/50e0e42), [0296391](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/0296391))
- **The app's typeface is yours — Settings → Typeface, per device.** System, Space Grotesk or Aldrich, applied before first paint; `theme.toml` adds your own faces, and Settings → Terminal font (13–16, default 14) sizes the draft field separately ([edfe042](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/edfe042), [e6e9142](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/e6e9142))
- **Aldrich is the shipped default face, and no face is faked bold any more.** Every default mechanism moved with it, and `font-synthesis-weight: none` stops the engine inventing weights a face does not ship ([a960f1f](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/a960f1f))
- **`collie join` refuses an `http://` lead address unless `--insecure` is passed**, and an invite without the lead's certificate fingerprint is refused outright ([0029881](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/0029881))
- **A peer can reach its own lead.** The lead is dialled unpinned, because its front door terminates TLS and the pinned certificate can never be on the wire, while a witness stays pinned ([33fa455](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/33fa455))
- **Two upgrade guides that did not exist before.** `docs/upgrading.md` gains *Upgrading from 0.x to 1.x* for an operator and *You run a fork* for a checkout whose `origin` is not this repo, which `collie update` now refuses instead of force-detaching ([e9e4f85](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/e9e4f85), [05a4b23](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/05a4b23))
- **Collie ships binaries, and installs with one command.** Every `v*` tag publishes checksummed per-platform tarballs, `install.sh` verifies one and links it onto PATH without sudo, and `collie update` fetch-verify-swaps with auto-rollback (`--rollback`, `--major`, `COLLIE_TAG` to pin one release) ([73402b5](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/73402b5), [d2706d9](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/d2706d9))
- **Collie introduces itself as its own product, CLI-first.** The tagline, descriptions and manifest call it a phone UI for the agents in your terminal, the README became a hub plus nine `docs/` pages, and `collie start` probes for a multiplexer instead of assuming Herdr ([4261c03](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/4261c03), [4fc83ec](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/4fc83ec))
- **tmux is parsed and driven correctly on the versions people run.** tmux 3.4's escaped field separator is un-escaped, a listing that parses to zero rows on non-empty output is refused as an error, and a create under a `manual` `window-size` refuses rather than segfault tmux < 3.7 ([30add9a](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/30add9a), [b58cb61](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/b58cb61))
- **The five non-English translations read like native product copy.** 1851 German, Spanish, Japanese, Korean and Chinese strings were rewritten in an idiomatic register with placeholders verified key by key, English untouched, and the docs went through the same pass ([c516276](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/c516276), [f7c38f7](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/f7c38f7))
- **Collie collects nothing, and that is written down.** No install events, usage statistics, crash reporting or analytics; the one unprompted outbound call is the anonymous update check, recorded in `docs/security.md` and [ADR 0034](.adr/0034-collie-collects-nothing-and-opt-in-is-the-ceiling.md) ([31d18dc](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/commit/31d18dc))

## [0.36.0] - 2026-08-28

- **AGY: a bare `>` transcript row is never taken for the composer** — only the boxed composer counts, so an echoed message cannot authorise a reply into a running turn (530057f)
- **Sign-in banner instead of "Can't reach Collie" behind a forward-auth proxy** — an expired session answered with a 3xx is read as a 401, and Authentik's `/outpost.goauthentik.io/` start/callback paths bypass the PWA cache — thanks @lekoOwO (#130) (e59135e)
- **AGY (Antigravity CLI) first-class harness adapter** — `ask_question` menus, permission, plan and trust dialogs lifted into native buttons, the boxed composer stripped with its status row re-surfaced, a slash-command palette and the brand icon — thanks @Kryvonis (#99) (b9a14e2)
- **Codex CLI 0.150.1 is recognised again, on both of its status rows** — the `Context`-bearing shape with `Context` directly after the model (thanks @fbserg, #134, 75a865a), and the two-field default that carries no `Context` field at all, now keyed on the row's renderer paint (dim ` · ` separators between coloured fields) and never on field names (ddf7272); pinned by five byte-faithful 0.150.1 captures (52cf214)
- **Codex: a large send is verified through `[Pasted Content N chars]`** — the exact character count is the evidence Enter waits for, per ADR 0010 — thanks @memset0 (#132) (1b76371)
- **Codex: the dim `Ask Codex to do anything` placeholder is empty; the same words typed are a draft** — thanks @memset0 (#132) (d3a0c53)
- **Codex: destructive writes bind to the whole wrapped draft**, not only the first `›` row — a message that wraps past the bridge's tail window no longer 409s every pre-clear sweep — thanks @memset0 (#132) (35a5e33)
- Known limit: Codex keeps only the first 1,024 characters of one send: a longer message shows as `[Pasted Content 1024 chars]` and the guard refuses to press Enter rather than submit a cut message. Herdr delivers every byte (probe in `HERDR_API.md`, b227ba5), so the limit is Codex's own, and a send is never chunked (ADR 0010)
- Known limit: While a Codex turn runs, the composer paints a `»` marker the adapter does not yet recognise, so a mid-turn reply is refused, never mis-sent; a byte-faithful capture of that state is wanted (see the #132 thread)

## [0.35.0] - 2026-08-26

**BREAKING — read before updating.**

- `COLLIE_PUBLIC_HOSTS` is now **required** on every reverse-proxy or tunnel install (Variant C/E) — Host validation fails closed.
- With `COLLIE_TRUSTED_USER` set, a request carrying no `Tailscale-User-Login` is now rejected; tagged nodes used to pass.
- A non-loopback `COLLIE_HOST` refuses to start.
- Opt-outs, one per gate: `COLLIE_ALLOW_ANY_HOST=1`, `COLLIE_TRUSTED_USER_OPTIONAL=1`, `COLLIE_ALLOW_NON_LOOPBACK_BIND=1`.

- Uploads are typed by magic bytes, not the client-supplied Content-Type — `__proto__` and `constructor` used to pass the MIME lookup (b0f6711)
- `collie-ctl.sh` parses `.env` as key=value instead of sourcing it — a `.env` with `$(…)` or backticks ran as the operator on every verb; an unquoted trailing `# comment` is now stripped (b0f6711, 743218f)
- An unversioned managed checkout pins `update` to the newest release tag, never origin HEAD (b0f6711, 4440c05)
- Host-header validation is on by default and fails closed; `collie-ctl.sh` injects the tailnet name and IPs, `COLLIE_ALLOW_ANY_HOST=1` opts out (b0f6711) — thanks @bartholomewtj (#129)
- `COLLIE_TRUSTED_USER` rejects a missing `Tailscale-User-Login` as well as a mismatch; `COLLIE_TRUSTED_USER_OPTIONAL=1` restores the old pass (b0f6711)
- A non-loopback `COLLIE_HOST` refuses to start unless `COLLIE_ALLOW_NON_LOOPBACK_BIND=1`; non-loopback TCP peers are rejected (b0f6711)
- **`quick-replies.toml`: your own Quick-dock groups** (title + items + optional `scope`), live-reloaded, replacing the shipped phrases on the panes they address per ADR 0018, shell panes reachable via `scope = "shell"` (0296391) — thanks @fucx (#131)
- A failed `tailscale status` no longer writes an empty host allowlist into the unit — the unit keeps the hosts it had, and says so (743218f)

## [0.34.0] - 2026-08-24

- `COLLIE_SERVE_PORT`: publish the https front door on a chosen tailnet port — several Collies per host (#98) (f008b75)

## [0.33.0] - 2026-08-24

- **Codex CLI first-class harness adapter** — boxless composer chrome stripped with the status row re-surfaced, folder-trust prompt, exec approvals and `request_user_input` question cards lifted into native buttons (by @kennymcavoy) (801c5a3)
- **omp replies no longer stall on an inline completion suggestion** — the ghost omp paints after the typed text is dropped from the draft the send guard verifies (by @enieuwy) (024a63b)
- **Codex adapter review fixes** — drafts wrapping past 8 rows keep the composer, and the persistent "don't ask again" approval row stays visible in the mirror (375f5b1)
- **`journal-probe` checks each root on its own** — a populated healthy root can no longer hide a broken sibling (by @kennymcavoy) (12b65e6)
- **Grok Build first-class harness adapter** — composer chrome stripped with the status strip re-surfaced, permission cards, `ask_user_question` radios/wizards and plan approval lifted into native buttons, plus a Grok session-journal adapter (by @kennymcavoy) (6f6b9e5)

## [0.32.1] - 2026-08-23

- **`url` (and `status`/`qr`) honour `COLLIE_PUBLIC_URL`** instead of always inferring the bare tailnet name with no port (#122) (d4e7380)

## [0.32.0] - 2026-08-19

- **The update banner says which kind of behind you are** — an in-major release, or a pending new major with the consent command (ce9dcd8)
- **F1–F12 in the Keys tray, behind an "F keys" disclosure** — chords with armed modifiers included (#119 by @martin-tahli) (f3d5845)
- **A cold boot with no network renders the cached last screen**, dated "last seen HH:MM" — never a false "No agents" (0f4c651, c473aa0)
- **A stale pane mirror is dated by its own stamp, not the herd's** (20cc1e1)
- **The update gate (ADR 0020)**: a routine `update` follows release tags within the installed major; crossing a major takes explicit consent — `update --major`, wired as the `update-major` plugin action (1b7ccfb)
- **The linked-clone major gate judges the branch's own upstream (`@{u}`), not the remote default branch** (142d2aa)
- **`keys.toml`: your own Keys-tray preset rows** (label + chords + optional `danger`), live-reloaded, replacing the shipped presets on the panes they address per ADR 0018 (a22da1a)

## [0.31.1] - 2026-08-18

- **A long request survives socket backpressure** — Bun's socket accepts fewer bytes than it is handed under pressure and queues nothing; the dialer now parks the tail and resumes from `drain`, so a big request can no longer silently truncate and die on the timeout (55274e7). Probed while fixing: herdr drops any request line of 1 MiB or more — now in `HERDR_API.md`
- In-code pointers name `DEPLOYMENT.md` now that variants B–E live there (ab182f7); `COLLIE_MULTI_SESSION` spelled `on`/`off` everywhere; `push-keys`/`push-test` listed in the Commands table (6948a0f)

## [0.31.0] - 2026-08-18

- **Your own slash commands in the palette, declared in `commands.toml`** — on a pane your rows address they replace the shipped catalog (ADR 0018); `confirm = true` adds a two-tap; edits are live, no restart (#109, 35da673, 28bdf5a) — thanks @enieuwy
- **Direct typing no longer owes a "mode stopped" notice to the next pane**, and the blur it schedules is settled by cancellation instead of racing a re-arm (#108, 452da20, 1a2ca49) — thanks @enieuwy
- **`COLLIE_AUDIT_CONTENT=none` keeps the audit trail and drops the bodies** — a fail-closed allowlist keeps action parameters legible while anything operator- or screen-originated redacts (#107, 5dda876, cdad445) — thanks @shuangwangnyc
- **`push-keys` generates the VAPID keypair and writes it into the right `.env`** — Web Push setup is now three plugin actions (`push-keys` → `restart` → subscribe), no manual key wrangling (84abe28)
- **"Tap to type" can be turned off** — a display setting stops the mirror volunteering the keyboard on a tap; on by default (1fbba59)
- **⚠ A paste too big to persist no longer restores an older, shorter draft after a remount** — oversize drafts now ride an in-memory tier whole, never truncated and never swapped for stale text; they survive pane switches but not closing the app, and the composer says so (7830c80)
- **A half-arrived long send is no longer accepted as send evidence** — when the input box ends in literal text it must be the end of what was sent, or the guard refuses to press Enter (#110, 27f4cdf)
- **README cut to ~60% of its length, how-first** — deployment variants B–E now live in `DEPLOYMENT.md`, and troubleshooting entries are findable by the words you'd actually search (9464c14, c52d4af)

## [0.30.0] - 2026-08-16

- **A password prompt says what it is and offers the control that works.** `sudo`, an SSH passphrase and `gpg` echo nothing, so Send's verification can never arrive — the refusal now names that and hands off to **Type** in one tap, instead of "a menu or dialog is probably up" (#103, 1334540)
- **A password typed into the composer is no longer kept for 48 hours** — recognising the prompt drops the stored draft and stops persisting keystrokes; the write-through had stored it before any send was attempted (#103, 1334540)

## [0.29.0] - 2026-08-16

- **The plan dialog's feedback row has a route from the phone.** Row 3/4 is a text input, not an option: Collie now models it, locks the other buttons while the terminal owns it, and sends feedback through the guarded choreography — digit, verified paste, bound Enter (#95, c0ce09e, 967e94d, 64de1d4) — thanks @navidkashani
- **A pane is named by what its process says it is doing** — its OSC title, glyph-stripped and dropped when it only repeats the agent or project — so a project's herd stops reading as N identical rows (#100, 9dbc0fe) — thanks @praneetrohida
- **A long plan-feedback value re-flows across lines instead of windowing** — the value is rebuilt from continuation lines and the footer gap widened, so a 355-char value no longer makes the whole dialog vanish (#95, 64de1d4)
- **A shell's `user@host:cwd` title is a locator, not a name** — it no longer replaces the row's cwd with a longer restatement of it (#100, 982b8e1)
- **A push re-subscribe replaces the row it supersedes**, and each row records when and from which browser it was made — Apple keeps answering 201 for an orphaned endpoint, so this is what stops `push-subscriptions.json` growing forever (#104, 0021300)

## [0.28.0] - 2026-08-12

- **omp gets a harness adapter (Tier 1)** — read-only blocks by construction, its own composer chrome stripped, a slash palette sourced from its captures — a reply stops confirming its pickers (#93, b98b90d) — thanks @qaz74107410
- **The destructive pre-clear sweep now fires only after a live read positively sees the composer**, bound to the prompt it saw — a dialog opening in the gap can no longer eat the burst (#93, 6c8332f)
- **Update-available pushes to Apple devices never arrived — broken since 0.11.0.** The Web Push topic was an impossible base64 length and APNs refused it; herd alerts were unaffected (#90, 19572d7) — thanks @ojulean
- **Every `COLLIE_*_ROOT` (including `COLLIE_TRANSCRIPT_ROOT`) takes a comma-separated list**, so pane history works across multiple `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` profiles (#92, b549101)
- **`contrib/windows/`** — a community-maintained Task Scheduler lifecycle for Windows (#71, 8572e49) — thanks @Pimpmuckl

## [0.27.0] - 2026-08-10

- **Idle Claude panes no longer scroll up and snap back on every poll** — the session-name sniffer read `recent`, which on a pane shorter than the read makes Herdr scroll a full-screen agent to reach the rows above it; it reads the visible grid now (#85, dab122e) — thanks @OowhitecatoO
- **A lapsed session behind a redirecting identity proxy shows the Sign-in banner** rather than "can't reach Collie" — API requests now carry `X-Requested-With`, so a proxy answers 401 instead of a 302 that `fetch` follows into an opaque CORS failure with no status to classify (#86, 0dc852e) — thanks @ojulean
- **`start` and `status` say when this node's packet filter admits no peer**, instead of printing the tailnet URL under a green ✓ that no other device can open — the local probe only ever sees loopback, which never touches the filter. Best-effort and deliberately unsure: it speaks up only on a total deny, and stays silent whenever it can't tell (#87, 82bbe0e) — thanks @adrgarcha
- **`collie-ctl.sh qr` prints the tailnet URL as a scannable code**, so a phone doesn't have to type a MagicDNS name — opt-in as its own subcommand, since a PWA only needs the URL once. Corrects two defects in the renderer it uses: its filled glyph is a *light* module, so the compact output inverts on a light terminal, and its quiet zone is 1–2 modules where the spec asks 4 (#88, ff84538) — thanks @adrgarcha

## [0.26.0] - 2026-08-10

- **GFM tables render as tables** in Conversation history instead of collapsing into one run-on paragraph — recognised by their delimiter row, alignment and ragged rows included. A table nested in a list or blockquote still collapses: the block parser is flat, and agents put tables at the top level (#72, d82ef1b)
- **Nerd Font symbol glyphs stop rendering as tofu** — two subset woff2 faces ship with the app, fetched only when a pane actually paints a private-use glyph (`unicode-range`) and deliberately kept out of the precache (#70, d31d97d)
- **The ctl test suite re-initialised the repository it was run from** — git exports `GIT_DIR` into hooks, which overrides discovery for every git command including `-C`, so the sandbox's `git init` landed on the developer's own checkout (d12b522)
- **The ctl suite failed on a Homebrew Mac** — `resolve_bun`'s absolute-path fallback escaped the sandbox PATH and brought the real `tailscale` back with it, defeating the missing-CLI case (b9cf620) — thanks @tyamanak
- **A quick Ctrl+C in the nav tray's Esc/Up gap** — one tap, without opening Presets (#75, d139b1b) — thanks @Jarva
- **Sends stalled on a narrow pane with "Message didn't reach the input box"** — the guard located Claude's input box by a run of 20 rule glyphs, which is a hidden assumption that the pane is at least 20 columns wide; it now measures display cells, and the wrapped-draft scan reaches past a long CJK draft (#76, de88b38) — thanks @tyamanak
- **A long terminal rule clips at the mirror edge** instead of wrapping into several rows; its full text stays in the DOM, and ordinary output keeps wrapping normally (#79, 4480019) — thanks @en-ver
- **Type into terminal** — a toggle beside Keys in the Controls row sends what you type straight to the pane as keystrokes, no trailing Enter, so a TUI that wants bare letters (`b`, `q`) can be driven from a phone. Ordered and batched, so a slow tailnet grows the next batch instead of scrambling characters; it never survives a pane switch, a lock, a hidden page or a failed batch (#74, 7dea503) — thanks @aspiers
- **The composer row reads its own state** — an open dock or an armed mode carries a light-sky tint instead of a grey surface, the attach button moves inside the text field, and the "Controls" tag floats above the row so four labelled toggles fit a 390px phone unclipped (5f9d5ee)

## [0.25.0] - 2026-08-07

- **A subscription that keeps failing is retired** after 5 consecutive failures, so stale duplicates (PWA reinstalls) stop accumulating and re-logging every cycle — counted only when a sibling on the same push service succeeded that round, so a service-wide rejection never costs a live device (#68, dcc4f48) — thanks @alshedivat
- **Push failures log the status and the service's reason** instead of web-push's constant "Received unexpected response code", which named neither (dcc4f48)

## [0.24.2] - 2026-08-06

- **A wrapped CJK reply stalled unsubmitted** — the input box folds its wrapped lines with a space, fabricating one the send never had (CJK has no spaces to wrap at), so the guard's slice check could never match; each seam is now judged on its own, and only a gap the fold itself could have made is loosened (#66, 6def208) — thanks @tyamanak
- **The guard feature-detects `Intl.Segmenter`** and falls back to code points, so an engine without it (Firefox < 125, Safari < 14.1) loses grapheme precision instead of white-screening the app at boot (1a37e29)

## [0.24.1] - 2026-08-06

- **Long/multi-line replies to Claude panes stalled unrecoverably** — the send guard now reads Claude's `[Pasted text #N +M lines]` placeholder as send evidence when consistent with the sent message (ADR 0010) (29bca11)
- **Stranded-draft preview withdraws "Take over" when the line holds only Claude's paste placeholder** (29bca11)

## [0.24.0] - 2026-08-05

- **Buttons for Claude's `/model` picker, and any modal like it** — a last-resort grammar reads the footer's `<key> to <verb>` hints and renders them, with the arrows the screen advertised, over the mirrored region (dfff364)
- **A generically-detected menu never synthesises a digit** — in the `/model` picker a digit confirms *and* saves your default for new sessions; [ADR 0009](.adr/0009-a-generic-menu-is-driven-by-the-keys-it-names.md) records why (dfff364)
- **A send is refused before it types when the agent's input box isn't on screen** — the draft is kept, and a second Send is a deliberate "Type anyway?" that still never fires the submit key blind (bf7ea38)
- **A reply is no longer typed into a full-screen picker** — the original `/model` bug: no grammar claimed the screen, so the message fed the picker and came back "stalled" (bf7ea38, dfff364)
- **The stalled message says a key answer probably landed** — the part that made the original report confusing (bf7ea38)
- **A half-written reply survives leaving the pane** — drafts are kept per pane (48h, localStorage, so an OS-killed PWA doesn't lose one) instead of dying with the composer when you step over to another tab (50dccc0)
- **The ←/→ pair says what it adjusts** — the picker's live value ("◐ Medium effort") sits between the arrows and in their accessible names (4d23e63)
- **Modal menus are a documented harness contract** — the model and its footer/key grammar are harness-neutral, so a future codex/pi/opencode adapter implements them from types plus a conformance leg, not from Claude's internals (a3e0820)
- **Every dialog model is a harness contract, not a Claude internal** — the prompt-select, wizard, preview and multi-select payloads join menus in harness-neutral modules, so the AST and the renderers no longer point at one agent's grammar (a7d45f4)
- **One race guard for every dialog, run through the pane's own adapter** — no more re-deriving through Claude's detectors; an adapter that emits a block kind gets the guard for free, and no adapter fails closed (211cd07)
- **The conformance suite pins the signature + identity contract for every block kind** — not just menus: a constant signature, or a comparator that passes a screen that changed, now fails CI (3385193)

## [0.23.3] - 2026-08-04

- **The idle lock no longer ambushes you on the way back in** — a hidden page never locks and returning to the foreground auto-resumes, so it can only appear when Collie is left open, visible and untouched (799ece0)
- **A pause no longer eats an in-progress reply** — the cover sits over a still-mounted router instead of replacing it, so draft, scroll position and open sheets survive it (799ece0)
- **The lock screen is glass, marked, and honestly worded** — the herd stays legible underneath, the Collie mark says whose screen it is, and there's no lock glyph or "for safety": it gates nothing, and [ADR 0007](.adr/0007-the-idle-lock-is-a-pause-not-a-gate.md) records why (799ece0, c7430a7)
- **`ARCHITECTURE.md` no longer lists the idle timeout as a security measure** — it never implemented one (799ece0)
- **Resuming shows the catch-up instead of handing back a frozen screen** — the cover holds through the refetch, badge swapped for the gallop, and releases when it settles (c7430a7)

## [0.23.2] - 2026-08-04

- **Agent alerts now send at high urgency** — at web-push's default (`normal`) Android was free to defer them by Doze / App Standby bucket, so pushes were accepted by FCM and never delivered (90e42af)

## [0.23.1] - 2026-08-03

- `update` now works in a `herdr plugin install` checkout — it is detached and shallow, so `git pull --ff-only` could never run there (#63) (00fd82c)
- `update` no longer re-links a Herdr-managed checkout, which would re-register it as local and block `herdr plugin install` (00fd82c)

### Upgrading — `herdr plugin install` users must reinstall once

The fix ships *inside* the checkout it repairs, so `invoke update` still can't run on an install made
before 0.23.1. Take the fix with one reinstall (config and serve state live outside the checkout and
survive), after which `invoke update` works normally:

```bash
herdr plugin install AltanS/collie --yes
herdr plugin action invoke restart --plugin herdr.collie
```

Installs from a `git clone` + `herdr plugin link` were never affected — use `invoke update` as usual.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-08-03

- **Every key press and quick reply now answers you.** A nav-tray press was silent on success and deferred to a mirror that can be ~2s behind, so tapping Enter felt like nothing happened; the pressed button now fills on the tap (synchronous, no network wait) and shows a ✓ once the bridge accepts it. Quick replies echo on the tapped button and the dock outlives the send, closing after the ✓ instead of on the tap (79682b5)
- **The pane's two control rows are now one.** Wrap, raw terminal and text size moved behind a ⚙ into a labelled panel — the raw-terminal escape hatch had been a bare `>_` glyph whose only explanation was a `title` attribute no phone ever shows, and it now says what it does. Find moved to the header, where its find bar already takes over the row. The mirror gets ~85px back (79682b5) — general direction from @simonallfrey in #49, whose "consolidate the terminal toolbar" proposal is what started this; thank you
- A single key press revalidates on the leading edge instead of sitting out the full 300ms burst window before its refetch even started; bursts still coalesce into one trailing refetch (79682b5)
- **Hold an arrow key to repeat it** — driving a long TUI menu no longer means tapping ↓ fifteen times. Repeats accumulate locally and flush as one batched `send_keys` array with exactly one call in flight, because ordering across two concurrent one-shot RPCs is unguaranteed. Arrows only, by whitelist; a hold while composing stages one chip, not fifteen (df40373)
- **Haptics** — a short buzz on press, toggleable in Settings, silently absent where the platform has no `vibrate` (df40373)
- **Quick replies follow the pane kind:** a shell gets `y`/`n` instead of "commit and push" and "skip", which mean nothing at a bash prompt (df40373)
- Closing the Keys dock on a composed key queue takes a second tap. The queue is still discarded rather than persisted — one surviving into a later open would let Send fire yesterday's chord into today's TUI state — and the guard sits on the drawer transition, since the Keys toggle and the Quick/Agent/Display buttons unmount the tray just as effectively as the ✕ (df40373)

## [0.22.0] - 2026-08-03

- **A multiselect question inside a wizard is now a tappable dialog**, not raw terminal text. It was owned by no grammar — wizards refuse checkboxes (a wizard digit selects *and* advances; a checkbox digit only toggles) and multi-select only knew the single-question form. It now carries the wizard's step chips, navigates with the wizard's own Left/Right keys, and reads the advance row's label ("Next" / "Submit") from the pane by position, never by assumption (#51, bdf4c26) — thanks @konpyl
- **A preview dialog whose option label wraps no longer falls to the raw mirror.** The grammar required numbered rows on consecutive lines, but the ~30-column gutter wraps longer labels onto continuation rows; a contiguity walk anchored on the label column replaces adjacency (#51, bdf4c26) — thanks @konpyl
- `multi-select-action.ts` no longer carries a literal NUL byte (git classified it binary and hid its diffs from review); `.gitattributes` keeps any future stray byte from costing reviewability (#51, bdf4c26)
- `ReadSource`'s unwrapped variant matches the wire: `recent_unwrapped`, snake_case — the kebab spelling was rejected by Herdr and nothing had ever called it. HERDR_API.md records the probed contract, including that the source is a byte-identical no-op for Claude panes (alt screen + renderer-hard-wrapped prose), which is what closed #53 part 2 by measurement (45cc23e)
- **OpenCode panes get Conversation history.** OpenCode ≥1.x keeps every session in one SQLite database (no per-session log), so its journal adapter reads `opencode.db` readonly with bound parameters, touches only the three transcript tables (the same file holds auth tokens), and serves all sessions through a per-session cache key. Needs `herdr integration install opencode` once, then restart OpenCode in the pane (#61, 539cdf4) — reported by @xabilarra

## [0.21.0] - 2026-07-31

- **Sending no longer stalls under a tall statusline** (the run may be 8 rows, was 3). A taller run made `locateInputBox` miss the input box, so a send typed the text and then withheld Enter — with no stranded-draft preview and no pre-clear sweep, so retries stacked duplicates in the pane. Reproduced on a 3-row statusline sitting one wrapped line from the cliff (#54, #56, fe8e548) — thanks @stekman08
- The pi journal fixture is portable to macOS, where `containedRealpath` resolves `/var` → `/private/var` by design and the backend suite couldn't run at all (7e99645)
- ADR 0004 records that the statusline-run bound guards less than it looks: a dialog below the input box is refused by the border checks and by the blank line above its footer hint, never by the row count (48b3ede)
- **macOS supervises the bridge with launchd.** `start` installs a LaunchAgent (`~/Library/LaunchAgents/herdr.collie.plist`), so the bridge comes back at login and restarts on failure — the parity with the `systemd --user` unit that macOS never actually had (#55, #57, a0be73d) — thanks @darieldatoon
- `launchctl bootstrap` is retried across launchd's teardown window, so `restart` — and therefore `update` — can't end with the bridge down (3776845)
- **The mirror wraps by default.** Herdr spawns panes at the desktop terminal's width against a phone's ~45–50 columns, so panning was the common case, not the exception; column-faithful no-wrap stays one tap away in View. Display prefs reset to defaults on first load (storage key v4), so a pinned font size needs setting again (#53, 273d886, 73cc7da) — reported by @waynehoover
- **The statusline strip shows every row of the run, in the agent's own colour.** Model, cwd, git branch and permission mode live on rows 2+ and were surfaced nowhere; the strip renders them stacked, in the mirror's colour space (#60, 61db7a5, ac3c62d)
- A Mac that can't bootstrap (no console login, so no `gui/<uid>`) keeps an unsupervised bridge instead of exiting with nothing running; `status` reports that degraded tier (05f8f48)
- **macOS installs migrate on the next `update` or `start`**: the old unsupervised bridge is stopped and replaced by the LaunchAgent. It's a *LaunchAgent*, so it starts at **login**, not at boot — and a Mac administered purely over SSH has no `gui/<uid>` to bootstrap into, so it stays on the unsupervised bridge with a warning until someone logs in at the console once.

## [0.20.2] - 2026-07-30

- `herdr plugin action invoke update` no longer dies with `bun not found on PATH` — Herdr spawns actions with no login shell, so Bun is now found in its install locations too, not just on `PATH`. A failed run had already fast-forwarded the checkout, leaving the old `web/dist` being served (#52, 08f44f6) — thanks @konpyl
- Only an absolute Bun path is prepended to `PATH`, so a `bun` shell function in the plugin `.env` can't put the CWD in front of `git` / `systemctl` / `tailscale`; the control script's Bun resolution now has test coverage (a50240a)

## [0.20.1] - 2026-07-29

- Journal rotation-following re-checks containment, so a sibling symlinked out of the Claude projects root can no longer be served as a pane's history (389618c)
- Dependency versions must be 7 days old before they install, via `bunfig.toml` (`.npmrc` for npm users) (3a16f31)

## [0.20.0] - 2026-07-29

Three contributions from @konpyl carry this release — light and system themes (#41), the triaged
dashboard (#42) and tappable URLs in the mirror (#45), landed via #46/#47/#48 with review fixes on
top. Thank you: measured rather than estimated, with the reasoning written down where it will be
argued about again.

- **The space and tab chip rows overlapped each other on the space screen** — both strips were missing `shrink-0` inside the route's flex scroller, so they collapsed to 16px around 32px chips and the tab row painted over the space row. Pre-dates this release (5e10bb0)
- **Light and system themes.** Collie follows your phone's appearance by default; pin Light or Dark from **Settings → Appearance**. Per device, and documented under [Dark mode / light mode](./docs/configure.md#dark-mode--light-mode) (#41, cd47bba, df47112)
- ANSI slots 0–15 are now CSS variables (`--ansi-*`), so indexed terminal colour is defined in one place and reaches the mirror through both `31m` and `38;5;1` spellings (cd47bba)
- Three `role="alert"` warnings (incomplete multi-select, wizard, preview) used a hardcoded yellow that measured ~2:1 on white; they use the status palette now (cd47bba)
- An off notification switch was unreadable in light — a white thumb on a 1.09:1 track, legible only by its shadow. It carries an outline now (cd47bba)
- Focus rings were drawn at half strength, 1.77:1 in light and 1.87:1 in dark; both are full strength now (cd47bba)
- Small muted text (section labels, the build stamp, the terminal status line, the `(n)` counts) fell under 3:1 in light — light `--muted-foreground` had no headroom left for the `/70` and `opacity-60` modifiers stacked on it, so it was darkened and the modifiers dropped (cd47bba)
- Header controls had 20px touch targets; the Settings gear and the Settings back button are both 44px now, with no change to how they look (cd47bba)
- In light, the page is a step off white with cards staying white, so the dashboard's hierarchy no longer rests on a single hairline — and the mirror's edge stops showing a seam (cd47bba)
- The pane mirror renders in dark space under every theme and light mode inverts it, because agents emit truecolor almost exclusively and no palette can re-theme an absolute colour — [ADR 0002](.adr/0002-invert-the-light-terminal-mirror.md) (26db8f1)
- **Ready · unseen** — agents that finished while you weren't looking. Opening one clears it, on every device (4a03951)
- The bridge keeps two timestamps per pane (`activeAt`, `seenAt`) in `activity.json`, because Herdr reports none (4a03951)
- **The dashboard is triaged, not listed.** Needs you → Ready · unseen → Working → Recent; the first three are pinned, Recent sorts by when you last used each pane (#42, 2c5f971)
- Recent and Spaces fold and remember it; fold both and the page is the triaged herd and nothing else (2c5f971)
- Spaces are ordered by last used and filterable — 45 of them are now three keystrokes, not a scroll (2c5f971)
- **Agent rows are titled `project · tab`, not "claude".** The pane's own name moves to the second line; the agent stays in the avatar (2c5f971)
- Spaces moved BELOW every agent section — it's a navigator, not a work queue (2c5f971)
- Only Collie's own reads count as seeing a pane; a Herdr focus at the desk does not — [ADR 0003](.adr/0003-one-shared-seen.md) (659c9d4)
- Marking a pane seen had made a read-level GET mutate state, so a cross-site `<img>` at a guessed pane id could silently clear your unseen agents. Only a request carrying the app's own header counts now — caught in this release's security review, never shipped (336c4c6)
- The swipe-up **Switch pane** sheet folds its long tails too — Recent, and the bare **Shells** group that buried the agents underneath it (90e1894)
- Titles truncated away the tab — the only part that identifies a row — leaving several panes rendering the same `moonward_os · t…` (f5e1e77)
- Section headings rendered at two different sizes and cases, because a `<button>` doesn't inherit `text-transform` from its `<h2>` (f5e1e77)
- A hollow status ring on the avatar's corner read as a notch cut out of the logo (16b01c8)
- **Light `--accent` was byte-identical to `--background`**, so "this is the current one" showed nothing in light mode — the open pane in the switcher, the current session, every `hover:bg-accent`. Predates this release; found by the UX sweep (b6850b4)
- **Tab and space chips carry a status dot** — blocked / ready / working / idle, in the herd list's own palette. They only ever showed a dot for blocked before, so every other state read the same as every other (bddf4cc)
- **URLs in the pane mirror are tappable** — `http(s)://` text becomes a link that opens in a new tab, keeping the colour the agent printed and marked by an underline (#45, e231ab4)
- Trailing prose punctuation is trimmed with paren balance respected, so `Fetch(https://x.dev/a)` links the URL and not the paren; a find hit inside a URL still highlights, and a URL that changes colour mid-way stays one link (e231ab4)
- The boot splash stepped from white to the page colour when React took over, and its caption measured 3.45:1 — it used `#ffffff`/`#8a8a8a` under a comment claiming they matched `--background`/`--muted-foreground`, which rasterize to `#f5f5f5`/`#5d5d5d`. Same fix for the light `theme-color` meta, so Android's URL bar matches the page (b02b800)
- Inverse-video segments in the mirror emitted theme tokens while the muted glyphs beside them used literals; the mirror keeps one spelling now (identical pixels — the literals are those tokens' dark halves) (b02b800)
- A space row and its chip could disagree about what a colour meant — the row still ranked by `STATUS_RANK` while the chip used the triage classifier, so a space holding one working agent and one unseen-done agent showed "working" on the dashboard and "ready" in the strip. Both route through `bucketOf` now, in one pass rather than spaces x agents per render (35c7f90)
- `aria-controls` on a collapsed section pointed at an element that isn't rendered — exactly when a screen-reader user is deciding whether to expand it (35c7f90)
- A status dot passed a smaller size only resized its wrapper, so chip dots rendered at the wrong size (35c7f90)
- The Settings page rearranged itself a frame after opening — Notify-when and Snooze mounted only once push state resolved, inserting ~400px into the middle of the page, and Notify-when then grew another ~180px waiting on its own prefs. Both render from the first frame now, switches disabled until their values land (87b875d)
- Herd and space rows had a border radius with no border to own it, so a rounded hover fill sat under a straight `divide-y` hairline. Rows without a border are square; the ones with a real border keep their radius (87b875d)
- The pane row ran straight into terminal output with no edge between them, so the chrome and the mirror read as one surface (e791330)
- Only a request that will actually be served marks a pane seen — one falling through to 405 no longer clears an alert (6b89899)
- MINOR, not MAJOR: pre-1.0, purely additive, no config or API break. Defaulting to your phone's appearance is the feature working as designed and Settings pins it either way; an older bridge reports no activity timestamps and simply renders the previous dashboard, minus the one section that would be empty

## [0.19.0] - 2026-07-29

- **Journal (pane history) is now per-harness, with Codex and pi support.** Reading an agent's own session log is an adapter keyed on the pane's agent (`bridge/journal/`), so a new harness is an adapter rather than a fork of the reader — Codex reads its date-partitioned `rollout-*.jsonl`, pi its per-cwd session log. Raised in #40 by @simonallfrey, who asked where to implement journaling for Codex (1bccb8e)
- **`scripts/journal-probe.ts`** probes every adapter against the real logs on the host — the format-drift check unit tests can't make. It caught Codex 0.145 adding a `developer` message role the parser would have rendered as operator speech (1bccb8e)
- **pi could never have had history.** pi reports its session as a kind-`path` ref (an absolute path) and the bridge kept only kind-`id` refs, so a pi pane arrived with no session at all. Both kinds are kept now; a path ref is confined to that harness's root after symlink resolution (1bccb8e)
- **A pane relaunched as a different agent served the previous agent's session ref.** Herdr keeps reporting the last session announced for a pane — a pane running pi still advertised a `herdr:claude` id. The ref is dropped unless its own `agent` matches the pane's (1bccb8e)
- **A pane's session reference no longer goes to the browser.** `/api/snapshot` sends `hasSession` instead — for pi the reference is a filesystem path, and the History affordance only ever needed "may this pane have history?". It is now also gated on the harness actually having an adapter (1bccb8e)

## [0.18.0] - 2026-07-28

- **Approvals are bound server-side to the prompt they were decided against.** `/keys` and `/reply` accept an optional `expected_prompt`; the bridge re-reads the pane immediately before writing and refuses with `409 prompt_changed` if the dialog moved. Shrinks the guard window from human latency to two local RPCs — a mitigation, not a guarantee, until herdr gains a conditional-input primitive (#29) — thanks @Optic00 (7ae589c)
- **`/auth/` is reserved for a fronting proxy's sign-in page**, and the service worker always passes it to the network. An installed PWA could not reach a proxy page at all before — the precache answered every navigation, reload included — so operators had to squat a page inside `/api/`. The refusal banner now links there (#31) — thanks @Optic00 (ee246d3)

## [0.17.0] - 2026-07-27

- **A reply sent while an agent dialog was focused answered the dialog instead.** The submit key approved whatever option was highlighted (Claude defaults to "Yes") and the message was destroyed, while the bridge reported success. Sending now refuses outright while a dialog is up, and otherwise types first and only submits once the text is verified in the input box (#34) — thanks @maikschuheida-spec
- Free-text replies on harnesses with a block grammar (Claude) are two steps — type, verify, submit — so "Sent ✓" now means the text was seen in the input box. Harnesses without an adapter keep the previous one-shot send

## [0.16.1] - 2026-07-27

- `/api/config` is now gated like every other endpoint — it was the one route that skipped the same-origin check and `COLLIE_PUBLIC_HOSTS`, noted by @Optic00 in #32 (629348e)

## [0.16.0] - 2026-07-27

- `scripts/collie-ctl.test.sh` — first lifecycle coverage for the control script, wired into the pre-push hook (a004449, c323610)
- `unserve`/`uninstall` no longer remove a `tailscale serve` mapping Collie didn't create, and `start` no longer replaces one (a004449, thanks @iamtimmy)
- A front door that fails to publish no longer aborts `start` before the status banner (c323610)
- Bring-your-own-tunnel deployment path documented as **Variant E** — NetBird, ZeroTier, Cloudflare Tunnel (7488e7a)

## [0.15.0] - 2026-07-26

- **Breaking, only if `COLLIE_DEVICE_HEADER` is set:** a request arriving *without* the device header is now read-only. It previously got full write access, which let any tailnet client reach the bridge's own URL and skip the proxy that injects the header. Front doors that inject it on every request are unaffected; direct loopback/MagicDNS access now needs the header sent by hand (#28) — thanks @Optic00 (f88f1d6)
- A 401/403 no longer renders as an endless "reconnecting" banner — an access refusal now says so and offers Reload (#30) — thanks @Optic00 (787b193)
- Pane conversation history read from the agent's own transcript — scroll back past the live mirror (465c485)
- `COLLIE_HERDR_DIAL=auto|net|bun` forces the dialer; `net` exercises the Windows path on Linux/macOS (4da4f03)
- Windows support for the bridge: dials herdr's named pipe through `node:net`, one code path for both platforms (#25, #27) — thanks @mikebenner and @bwright2810 (120f829)

## [0.14.2] - 2026-07-23

- Paste an image straight from the clipboard into the composer, same upload path as the picker (#24) (ffceb0f)

## [0.14.1] - 2026-07-22

- `collie-ctl.sh self_dnsname` shelled out to `node`, which Collie never requires — now uses `bun` (#22) — thanks @jz-wilson (6664ced)

## [0.14.0] - 2026-07-21

- HERDR_API.md: multi-modifier chords live-verified in any order against Herdr 0.7.3, cross-confirmed on 0.7.4 by @bnivanov (0d1472b)
- Alt modifier in the nav tray — `alt+<key>` chords now reachable from the phone (#19) — thanks @bnivanov (38e05cf)
- Modifiers combine (checkbox, not radio): `ctrl+shift+p`, `alt+shift+p`, even triple chords (#20) (38e05cf)
- Modifier lock — tap an armed modifier again to keep it armed across presses and Sends; Clear or a third tap releases (#20) (38e05cf)

## [0.13.2] - 2026-07-20

- Tabs render in Herdr's reported order instead of stable-number order, so a reorder in Herdr survives to the screen — thanks @iFwu (6a8e0f7)
- Tapping raw terminal output focuses the composer synchronously, keeping iOS's user-activation window so the software keyboard opens — thanks @iFwu (8ca41ca)

## [0.13.1] - 2026-07-20

- Taking over or sending a draft no longer permanently mutes the preview for that same text — the handled key resets once the host line clears (730f6c6)
- Send's pre-clear sweep overshoot widened 8 → 32 so host typing inside the poll gap can't leave a remnant (730f6c6)
- A scrollback line starting with `❯` can no longer pin a bogus session name — only the live (bottommost) prompt decides (d8744f4)

## [0.13.0] - 2026-07-19

- Pane rename end-to-end: `pane.rename` RPC, bridge route, label threading (317ec72)
- Long-press a pane pill for a pane actions sheet — rename + two-tap close (5b50941, c713551, 90210ce, ea20df0)
- Busy strip on genuinely hung loads: navigations >500ms, background polls >6s (e886541, 3bfaa1c, 06516c4)
- Own in-flight reply no longer flagged as a stranded terminal draft (15c1830)
- Gallop sprite re-centered; the dog never freezes mid-stride (rest state is the static icon) (3c7174a, 394e6fe)
- Offline banner no longer overlaps the sticky header (2e988f3)
- Sustained outages escalate everywhere — boot splash, header, banner — with Retry/Reload (0cbbac1, 4d89588, 4494cf5)
- `-dev` marker in the build stamp for non-release builds (32d76d6)
- Wrapped multi-line drafts and the new background-agents footer no longer break input-box detection (829fc7e, d9521e3)
- Claude's own `/rename` session name surfaced on cards, headers, and the switcher (7c6606c)
- Tab rename + tab close (blast-radius confirm) via the same long-press sheet on tab chips (a9664b5, 37a470e)
- `navigator.onLine` never gates polling or liveness — lying flags can't wedge the app or fake outages (d31ffb8, 394e6fe)
- Self-update without the service worker: `X-Collie-Build` on polled responses, auto-reload or tap-to-update banner (b83185a)
- `assets/*` served immutable, everything else `no-cache` — proxy caches can no longer starve `/sw.js` updates (b83185a)
- Read-only "Draft in terminal" preview with explicit Take over — the composer input is exclusively phone-owned (4b6f0ac, 10fa28d)
- Connection status is a single animated top bar — amber "reconnecting…" after 4s of trouble, red with Retry at 15s, green flash on recovery; no header pill (394e6fe, b2dd50e)
- One shared connection-lost clock; escalation survives route changes and app switches until a poll succeeds (1486e07, 5949885)
- One shared `AppHeader` for dashboard, space, and pane — same components underneath, stale status badges dim during outages (bc60ea6)
- Instant offline navigation — during a known outage, routes serve the last good snapshot instead of hanging on a dead fetch (6ba7dea)
- Switcher sections carry status-colored bullets; per-row close removed (switching is the only action there) (724bce3)

## [0.12.0] - 2026-07-17

- `COLLIE_SKIP_SERVE=1` env var to disable tailscale serve entirely — bridge stays on loopback only, ideal for deployments behind a reverse proxy (Caddy, Nginx, etc.) — thanks @diogenesc (791dfcc)
- `COLLIE_PUBLIC_URL` — `collie-ctl.sh status` banner shows your real reverse-proxy URL instead of a placeholder (ec01d66)
- Bridge startup warning when `COLLIE_TRUSTED_USER` is set under `COLLIE_SKIP_SERVE=1` — the identity gate is inert without tailscale serve injecting `Tailscale-User-Login`; use `COLLIE_DEVICE_HEADER` (ec01d66)
- README Variant C — reverse proxy as the only front door (no Tailscale), with Caddy example and required env (c5c3533)
- `collie-ctl.sh unserve`/`uninstall` always attempt serve teardown, even under `COLLIE_SKIP_SERVE=1` — a stale mapping from before the flag flip would keep publishing the app (ec01d66)
- Security posture docs: "tailscale serve is the sole ingress" → "exactly one hardened front door" (tailscale serve or a conforming reverse proxy) across README, ARCHITECTURE, CLAUDE.md (c5c3533)

## [0.11.1] - 2026-07-16

- Opening a tab/pane lands on the live tail — terminal `<pre>` no longer steals vertical scroll from the message list; stickiness also re-pins when content grows (8576152)

## [0.11.0] - 2026-07-15

- Pluggable harness-adapter architecture: a `HarnessAdapter` registry replaces the single Claude-only gate, Claude's detectors move to `lib/harness/claude/`, and a core race-guard engine (`lib/harness/guard.ts`) is the only module that may touch the network — an import fence (enforced by `fence.test.ts` under `bun run test`) + a conformance suite let contributors add codex/pi/opencode (see `HARNESS_CONTRIBUTING.md`)
- multiSelect AskUserQuestion support: checkbox options up-level to tappable checkbox rows (terminal is source of truth), with a closed-loop Submit that navigates the pointer to Submit and verifies before Enter (never blind-sends), plus the review/confirm screen
- Prompt overlay: interactive prompts render in a bordered `bg-card` panel that lifts the whole dialog off the terminal mirror, with elevated option rows, leading key-digit badges, and a family-aware caption
- Update notifications: a footer banner (linking to the GitHub release) and an opt-out web-push when a newer release is published upstream or the running bridge is behind the on-disk code — checks the repo's tags over anonymous HTTPS, stamps its own sources for the restart signal, a Settings "check for updates" button forces an immediate check, an `updates` notify pref is the off-switch, and update/restart are surfaced as location-independent Herdr plugin actions
- Prompt-select + wizard grammars: a numbered list in a dialog body (e.g. a plan's steps) no longer breaks menu detection — the menu is taken as the trailing `1..m` run, so plan-approval prompts up-level correctly
- Keys and Quick menus dock in-flow above the controls row instead of a fixed overlay, so the terminal mirror shrinks and re-pins to the bottom (ResizeObserver) — the prompt/cursor stays visible; both buttons are toggles
- Prompt option rows compacted (tighter padding, snug line-height) so a multi-option dialog fits the phone viewport
- "Sent" status toast moved from a bottom overlay (which covered the terminal tail) to a slim in-flow row below the header
- Build stamp marks a dirty working tree (`<sha>-dirty`), so the footer no longer claims HEAD when the build carries uncommitted work
- multiSelect Submit is ~2s instead of ~15s: the pointer walk re-reads the actual position each step and stops on "Submit", instead of polling for the bottom row after every key (which timed out ~2.8s per step)

## [0.10.3] - 2026-07-12

- `collie-ctl.sh build` installs the root dependency tree (not just `web/`) before typechecking, so a fresh Herdr install no longer fails with TS2688 "Cannot find type definition file for 'bun'" (03f409f, #9)

## [0.10.2] - 2026-07-12

- Composer Send clears a stranded draft off the terminal `❯` line (ctrl+k + Backspace) before typing so replies no longer accumulate on the prompt; a clean prompt skips the clear (412378f)
- Bridge settles ~350ms between typing and Enter so the TUI reliably accepts the submit key (412378f)

## [0.10.1] - 2026-07-11

- Terminal mirror defaults to no-wrap for table alignment like desktop Herdr; clearer borders/typography (font 12, muted-foreground box-drawing); pane stays viewport-width — toggle Wrap on in View for prose (85f777b)

## [0.10.0] - 2026-07-10

- Herdr session switcher: one bridge fronts every named herdr session — `?session=` on the API, `?s=` in the app, a sessions summary in the snapshot, per-session notification slots, and a `COLLIE_MULTI_SESSION` kill-switch (8fa1f20)
- Session switcher and the session chip are dashboard-only, keeping the in-space and pane headers clean (bb0048d, ba56ba9)
- Header polish: consistent compact height across the dashboard and inside a space, zinc-800 nav chrome, a ringed Collie mark, a smaller pane-header agent logo, and the keyboard-only quick-keys strip removed (6250e0c, 9da7195, 35db0e5, ba56ba9)
- Terminal-draft recovery: a queued-then-recalled message stranded on the "❯" input line surfaces as a composer chip, with "Edit here" to clear the line and adopt the text cleanly (46dcf35)
- Dashboard, space, and settings scroll inside a viewport-clipped region instead of the whole document (2aa9272)
- Space detail is a deep-linkable route (`/space/:spaceId`) with a working browser Back button, replacing the in-home drill-in state (0e5f9c8)
- Deep-linking a space that never existed shows "Space not found" rather than "Space closed" (fcb0b7d)
- Security posture documents that `COLLIE_MULTI_SESSION` (default on) fronts every named session under the config root (fcb0b7d)
- Dashboard leads with "Needs you" — agents awaiting your input sit at the top, above the spaces overview (1d92592)

## [0.9.1] - 2026-07-09

- Removed one-tap yes/no reply buttons from push notifications — they POSTed to the terminal without opening the app, i.e. approving blind. Notifications now only deep-link to the pane (cb26ee0)
- Unauthenticated `POST /pack/v1/enroll` no longer rewrites the trust store or appends an audit line on a no-op spend — write-amplification against the key/secret file (F4) (43b9a17)

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-07

- Quick keys mimic a physical keyboard on both surfaces: Esc top-left, Tab below it, inverted-T arrows, Enter top-right; Keys sheet gains a full-width spacebar (2f70662)
- Attach image lives in the reply row (usable without the phone keyboard open); digits leave the inline strip — the 123 tab remains (2f70662)
- Header collie logo is transparent like the gallop sprite — removed favicon.svg's baked-in gray backing rect (3f05da8)

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-07

- Poll herdr 0.7.2's `session.snapshot` — one RPC per tick instead of three list calls; permanent fallback to the list trio on older servers (5687bbf)
- Event-poked polling: `events.subscribe` stream triggers immediate debounced re-polls; interval relaxes to `COLLIE_POLL_IDLE_MS` (default 12s) while the stream is healthy (5687bbf)
- HERDR_API.md re-verified against herdr 0.7.2 / protocol 16; terminal observe/control filed under ARCHITECTURE.md Future ideas (aad94b3)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-06

- Notification type prefs: Settings "Notify when" toggles per agent status, bridge-wide; default pushes only "Needs input" (blocked) — "Finished" (done) is off (98cf5d2)
- Push sends carry a `collie-herd` topic + 6h TTL: an offline device now gets one current summary on reconnect instead of replaying every queued update (98cf5d2)
- Disabling a notification kind retracts its pending/outstanding alerts immediately (98cf5d2)

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-06

- First-paint PWA splash: the galloping collie shows before React mounts (299f632)
- Option taps no longer pop the phone keyboard or steal the note editor's focus (11385ee)
- Header Collie mark matches the agent logo (2rem, aligned across screens); Find lives in the composer View row; placeholder is just "Type a reply…" (11385ee)
- Keys sheet: `Ctrl` modifier + visible key queue — compose chords/sequences, review, Send as one call; dialer-size digits on a `123` tab (515f795)
- Stalled connections no longer zombify the app: fetch timeouts (10s/20s/60s), polls supersede a wedged revalidation at 12s, and the collie gallops within 2.5s of a stalled load or pane-tap navigation (e6ad939)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-05

- **Preview-variant question notes.** Claude Code's *preview* AskUserQuestion — a single-select
  question whose options carry a `preview` field (the mockup/snippet pane, footer hint
  `n to add notes`) — is lifted into a native block that surfaces the per-question note affordance.
  A note (attach / edit / remove) is driven from the native option UI and applies **per question**,
  not per option row. Delivery uses the verified staged keystroke choreography
  (`n` → confirm the input focused → clear → paste the text via the reply path → `Escape` to blur,
  each stage verified rendered before the next fires; `Enter` is never sent, since it would submit
  the dialog — see `web/src/lib/grammar/NOTES_NOTES.md`), and option selection is the two-step
  digit → verify-pointer → `Enter` recipe. Race-guarded like the other dialog blocks (a stale tap on
  a drifted dialog aborts before anything irreversible is sent). Claude-scoped (`hasBlockGrammar`)
  and web-only; the standard non-preview select and wizard steps are unaffected (pressing `n` there
  is a no-op, so no notes UI is shown).
- **Preview-note tap guard hardened to region-signature parity.** The preview dialog's race guard now
  carries a pointer- and note-independent **core signature** (the subject/question/stepper above the
  options joined with the option rows' left column, `❯` normalised) — matching the 0.4.0 `signature`
  parity the prompt/wizard guards already had. It is enforced at entry AND on **every** mid-flight
  acceptance/drift check, so a same-shaped successor dialog (identical question + labels, different
  subject) can no longer be answered by a stale tap: no digit-then-`Enter` or `Enter` is sent unless
  the fresh read's core signature byte-matches what the user saw. The blur poll is now three-valued
  (ok / drifted / timeout) so the Escape-retry fires only on a genuine swallowed key — never after the
  dialog drifted or vanished (which a blind second Escape could cancel / interrupt). Pasted note text
  is stripped of C0/C1 control bytes (ESC, BEL, …) before it can reach the focused input.
- Unauthenticated `POST /pack/v1/enroll` no longer rewrites the trust store or appends an audit line on a no-op spend — write-amplification against the key/secret file (F4) (43b9a17)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-05

- **Block-based terminal renderer.** Pane rendering now flows through a semantic Block AST (styled
  lines → typed blocks → React components) instead of a flat span mirror. The raw-block foundation is
  byte-for-byte identical to the old mirror, but it's the seam every feature below builds on —
  detected regions are lifted into native blocks in place, and anything unrecognized falls back to
  the raw mirror. Scoped to Claude Code (`hasBlockGrammar`); every other agent renders the plain
  mirror, since their TUIs are unverified.
- **Native prompt buttons.** A Claude single-choice dialog at the buffer tail (select, permission,
  trust, plan approval) is lifted out of the mirror and rendered as tappable buttons; a tap sends the
  per-family keystrokes (digit, or digit+Enter for AskUserQuestion), guarded so a stale tap on a
  scrolled-up menu can't fire. The agent's own input box/statusline are stripped so they don't
  duplicate the composer.
- **Status strip.** The stripped statusline (model · ctx% · cwd · branch · tokens) is re-surfaced as
  a slim line above the composer, so the branch/context stays visible instead of vanishing with the
  input-box chrome.
- **Submission progress bar.** A slim indeterminate bar across the top of the app while any mutation
  (reply, keys, prompt tap, upload, tab/space create, close, snooze) is in flight; background polling
  never triggers it, and a 120ms delay means a fast action never flashes it.
- **Raw-terminal escape hatch.** A View toggle (terminal icon) that turns off the block renderer —
  native prompt buttons, chrome stripping, status strip — and shows the plain mirror, so a
  mis-detected/mis-rendered dialog can always be driven by hand with the keys pad. Persisted.
- **Multi-question wizard.** A multi-question AskUserQuestion (the `☒ Focus area ☐ Scope ✔ Submit`
  stepper) now renders as a native step-by-step wizard instead of bailing to the raw mirror: the
  stepper chips (answered/current per question), the current question's options as tappable buttons
  (one digit each — verified: a wizard digit instant-selects and advances), back/next step
  navigation, and the final Submit review step (answers echoed, submit/cancel). Incremental
  round-trip: every tap is a single race-guarded keystroke re-derived against a fresh read; the TUI
  stays the source of truth. Choreography + fixtures documented in
  `web/src/lib/grammar/WIZARD_NOTES.md`.
- **Galloping Collie loader.** The mascot now doubles as the app's activity indicator: a 6-frame
  gallop sprite (`web/public/dog-gallop.png`, a 768×128 transparent strip) stepped through with a
  pure-CSS `steps(6)` animation (no JS timers). At rest it's the familiar static app icon
  (`favicon.svg`); it springs into the gallop on the boot splash while the first snapshot loads and
  whenever the connection isn't live (connecting / reconnecting / offline), settling back to the
  static icon once live. Honours `prefers-reduced-motion`. New `DogGallop` component; rough
  first-pass art to be replaced with higher-quality frames.
- **Multi-question AskUserQuestion no longer mis-parsed.** A multi-step AskUserQuestion (the
  `☒ Focus area  ☐ Scope  ✔ Submit` stepper) was detected as a single-question select and answered
  with one digit+Enter — submitting a half-filled form. It's now recognized as a wizard and left as
  the raw mirror (drive it with the keys pad, or via the new escape hatch) rather than mis-sending.
- **One consistent top-left mark on every screen.** The Collie is now the brand + home button +
  connection loader in a single shared `CollieHome` component, rendered identically on the dashboard
  and inside a pane — so the header's top-left always means the same thing (previously a "stacks"
  icon inside a pane vs. the Collie logo on the dashboard). Inside a pane the Collie gallops on
  reconnect from the same global connection state as the dashboard (shared `isConnecting` predicate).
- **The pane's Nav-hub drawer** (the left "stacks" drawer). It was redundant now that the Collie
  handles Home, the swipe-up switcher already covers pane switching/closing, and the breadcrumb
  covers cross-space jumps — removed along with its `SpaceList` component. The swipe-up switcher now
  appears whenever a pane is open, so even the last pane stays closable.
- **Prompt/wizard taps are guarded against same-shaped successor dialogs.** The tap race guard now
  compares a byte-signature of the whole dialog region — including the subject above the options (the
  diff/command being approved), not just the question and option labels. So a tap on a frozen mirror
  can no longer approve a *different* action that happens to render an identical-looking prompt (e.g.
  a second edit to the same file after the first was answered elsewhere). Herdr's `revision` is a
  stub, so this content signature is the load-bearing freshness check.
- Unauthenticated `POST /pack/v1/enroll` no longer rewrites the trust store or appends an audit line on a no-op spend — write-amplification against the key/secret file (F4) (43b9a17)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-03

A full-codebase review pass: four audit agents (backend, frontend, security, ops/product) swept the
tree; everything they found was verified, fixed, and the top feature gaps were built.

- **Reply from the notification.** Needs-you pushes now carry up to two quick-reply action buttons
  (agent-aware: codex gets `yes`/`no`, others `yes`/`continue`; bridge sends `quickReplies` in the
  payload). Tapping one POSTs the reply straight from the service worker and confirms with a silent
  "Sent ✓" — no app open needed. Body tap still deep-links as before.
- **Find in output.** A magnifier in the pane header opens a find bar: case-insensitive match over
  the visible buffer, match count, prev/next that cooperates with the scroll-freeze, highlights
  rendered through the same React-text-node path (XSS boundary untouched).
- **Load older scrollback.** A "load older" row at the top of the mirror grows the fetched window
  600 lines at a time (up to 5000; the bridge clamps reads at 10000), preserving your scroll
  position across the refetch.
- **Destructive-input confirm.** Replies matching a reviewed pattern list (`rm -rf`, `sudo`,
  `git push --force`, `dd if=`, `mkfs`, redirects to system paths, …) flip Send into a two-tap
  "Really send?" state for ~3s — same pattern the `/clear` palette action already used.
- **Audit log.** Every write action (reply, keys, upload, tab/workspace create, pane close) appends
  a single JSONL line — timestamp, action, pane, device, truncated params — to
  `<state-dir>/audit.log` (mode 0600). Audit failures never block the action itself.
- `COLLIE_PUBLIC_HOSTS` env var — an explicit Host-header allowlist. When set, requests addressed
  to any other Host are rejected before origin logic, defeating DNS rebinding. Strongly
  recommended (set it to your MagicDNS name); effectively mandatory with `COLLIE_SERVE_MODE=http`.
- Startup warnings when `COLLIE_TRUSTED_USER` or `COLLIE_PUBLIC_HOSTS` is unset — parity with the
  existing bind/allowlist warnings, since an empty trusted-user means any tailnet device has write
  access.
- Uploaded images are now swept after 48h (was: kept forever).
- **Socket leak on RPC timeout** — a stalled Herdr left the Unix-socket FD open on every timed-out
  request; under the 1.5s poll cadence this exhausted file descriptors and wedged the bridge. Every
  terminal path now closes the socket.
- **UTF-8 corruption across socket chunks** — multi-byte characters (box drawing, emoji) straddling
  a socket-read boundary rendered as `�`; replies are now stream-decoded.
- **Overlapping polls** — a slow Herdr let 1.5s ticks pile up 3-4 concurrent polls; a tick is now
  skipped while the previous poll is in flight.
- **Upload buffering** — a too-large upload was buffered fully into RAM before the 10MB check;
  oversized `Content-Length` is now rejected up front and `Bun.serve` caps request bodies at 12MB.
- Push subscription saves are serialized and written atomically (temp+rename); concurrent
  add/prune can no longer drop a subscription. State files are written 0600 in 0700 dirs.
- First PWA load no longer flashes an immediate reload (service-worker `controllerchange` on
  initial claim was treated as an update).
- A rotated VAPID key now unsubscribes the stale push subscription and re-subscribes fresh instead
  of silently dead-ending pushes.
- Superseded loader revalidations are aborted (`request.signal` threaded through); raw key presses
  debounce their revalidate (one refetch per burst instead of one per keystroke).
- Slash-command insert appends to the draft instead of overwriting it; tap-to-focus no longer
  collapses an active text selection (copying pane output works now).
- `envInt` config parsing rejects garbage and out-of-range values (negative poll/debounce
  intervals, invalid ports) with a warning instead of silently accepting them.
- Static-file path guard now checks the directory boundary (`dist` vs `dist-*`); `?lines=` is
  clamped; API/static responses carry `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and
  `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`; graceful shutdown drains in-flight requests.
- Pre-commit version guard now also covers `web/vite.config.ts`, `web/index.html`,
  `web/package.json`, `web/public/`, `systemd/`, and root `package.json`, and requires the new
  version to sort strictly above the old one.
- **Builds are gated.** `bun run build` (root) and `collie-ctl.sh build` now typecheck bridge and
  web before building, and build into `dist-staging` with an atomic swap — a failed build can no
  longer leave an empty `web/dist` serving 503s. The pre-push hook typechecks both sides too
  (`SKIP_TYPECHECK=1` to bypass once). Root tsconfig now enforces `noUnusedLocals/Parameters`.
- **Write requests without an `Origin` header are rejected** unless they arrive on loopback
  (browsers always send Origin on POST; curl-on-host keeps working).
- Idle lock is now timestamp-based: backgrounding/foregrounding the app no longer resets the
  countdown, and returning past the deadline locks immediately.
- The composer moved into its own `<Composer>` component; `agent-chat.tsx` slimmed by ~230 lines.
- A reply whose text lands but whose submit keystroke fails now reports "typed into the pane but
  not submitted — check the pane before resending" (and `textDelivered: true`) instead of a generic
  error that invited double-sends.
- systemd unit hardened (`NoNewPrivileges`, `PrivateTmp`) and made persistent
  (`StartLimitIntervalSec=0`, `RestartSec=5`) so a crash-loop can't leave the service permanently
  down while you're phone-only.
- Notification deep links URL-encode the pane id; sheets manage focus (focus in on open, restore on
  close, `aria-labelledby`); space status dots gained screen-reader text; pinch-zoom re-enabled
  (removed `maximum-scale=1`).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-30

- **Do Not Disturb / snooze** (Settings → *Do not disturb*): pause all push for 30m / 1h / 4h, or
  resume early. Server-enforced and self-expiring, so it quiets every device — and it clears whatever
  is already on the lock screen the moment you snooze. The current deadline rides the snapshot, so it
  stays in sync across devices.
- `COLLIE_NOTIFY_DELAY_MS` env var — the push debounce window in ms (default `30000`; `0` notifies on
  the next tick with no debounce).
- `POST /api/notifications/snooze` — set/clear the global snooze (`{ snoozedUntil: number | null }`);
  the active deadline is reported on the snapshot as `notifications.snoozedUntil`.
- **Smarter push notifications.** A blocked/done alert is no longer fire-and-forget. Each one now
  waits a short **debounce window** (`COLLIE_NOTIFY_DELAY_MS`, default 30s) before it sends; an agent
  you clear at your desk within that window never reaches your phone. Alerts that *do* fire are
  **retracted** automatically once the agent resolves (or its pane closes), so handled work stops
  piling up on your lock screen. The service worker also **suppresses** the system notification when a
  Collie tab is already open and visible (the in-app status surfaces it instead).
- **Coalesced into one notification.** The whole herd shares a single notification slot: one agent
  shows the named, deep-linked alert; several collapse into a *"N agents need you"* digest (tap → the
  triage home) that updates in place as agents come and go, instead of stacking N separate alerts.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-30

Initial public release of **Collie** — a phone web UI to monitor and reply to your Herdr agent
herd over Tailscale.

- **Mobile-first PWA** (Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 + shadcn): a triage dashboard
  (Spaces overview + Needs-you / Working / Idle agent groups), a per-agent colored terminal mirror,
  an agent-aware slash-command palette (Claude Code, Codex, pi, opencode), a special-keys pad with
  inline arrows/Tab, per-agent brand icons, image upload, and animated view transitions. Installable,
  with an auto-updating service worker and a build-stamp footer.
- **Bun/TypeScript bridge** over Herdr's Unix socket: a polled live snapshot (adaptive cadence,
  gzip + `ETag`/`304`) plus reply / keys / upload endpoints, and space/tab/pane management (create
  shell panes, switch, kill) through a unified nav hub.
- **Runs as a `systemd --user` service** supervised independently of Herdr, with a `tailscale serve`
  launcher (`scripts/collie-ctl.sh`) and a thin Herdr plugin (`herdr.collie`) exposing
  start / stop / restart / status / url / version / update / uninstall actions. One-command update
  (pull → rebuild → restart → re-link) for the linked checkout.
- **Optional Web Push (VAPID) notifications** when an agent needs you, with a custom service-worker
  push handler that renders the real message and deep-links the tap to the agent's pane.
- **Security posture:** loopback-only bind, `tailscale serve` as the sole ingress (never `funnel`),
  a same-origin gate, an optional `COLLIE_TRUSTED_USER` identity check, optional per-device
  authorisation via a trusted upstream header, a strict CSP, and terminal output rendered as React
  text nodes (the XSS boundary).
