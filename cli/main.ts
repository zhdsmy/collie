// The bootstrap. This module is the binary's entry point AND the entry point every from-source
// invocation goes through, and it exists as its own file for exactly one reason:
//
// ── THE BUILD PATH RUNS ON A BARE CHECKOUT ───────────────────────────────────
// `collie build` is what runs `bun install`. So the code that reaches it cannot itself need
// anything `bun install` would have put there. Two callers depend on that, and both are how Collie
// gets onto a machine in the first place:
//
//   * `scripts/collie-ctl.sh` builds the binary from source when the checkout has none — the shape
//     a fresh `herdr plugin install` leaves: no `bin/collie`, no `node_modules` (M6/01).
//   * `pack add` installs a peer by pushing a commit and running that same from-source build there
//     (`cli/remote.ts`'s install leg), on a checkout `git fetch` has JUST advanced — so its
//     `node_modules`, if it has one at all, predates the commit being built.
//     `cli/update.ts` re-execs `bun cli/main.ts _apply-update` for the same reason, on a checkout
//     whose dependency tree is likewise one commit behind.
//
// So: **nothing in this module's static import closure may resolve to a package.** Builtins
// (`node:*`, `bun:*`) and repo-relative files only, transitively — `cli/main.test.ts` walks the
// graph and fails the build if a bare specifier appears anywhere in it. A dependency that is loaded
// through a *dynamic* `import()` is fine, because it is only resolved if that branch runs: that is
// how `web-push` (bridge/push.ts), `qrcode-terminal` (scripts/qr.ts), ink/react (cli/ui/) and — as
// of this file — commander have always been reached.
//
// The verb table, the parser and everything else live in `cli/program.ts`, one dynamic `import()`
// away. The two verbs above are dispatched here instead, before it, by plain argv inspection.

/**
 * The verbs that must work with no dependencies installed, dispatched from this module rather than
 * from the table in `cli/program.ts`. They are still declared in that table — it is the single
 * declaration, and the usage line is built from it — but this is the path they actually take.
