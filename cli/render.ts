// Both of those are non-TTY, and both must keep seeing EXACTLY the lines they saw before the TTY
// view existed. So the rich renderer is not a formatting flag threaded through the verbs: it is an
// object that is either there or `null`, resolved here, and every verb that has a rich surface
// keeps its plain branch as the one that runs when it is `null`.
//
// The inputs are arguments rather than reads of `process`, so the decision is a pure function a
// unit test can drive through all of its corners without monkeypatching the runtime.

// **A verb that streams progress or prompts on stdin may have an ink surface if and only if that
// surface owns EVERY byte of the verb's output — prompts included — for as long as it is mounted.**
// Nothing else may write to stdout or stderr between mount and unmount: not a `console.log`, not a
// nested lifecycle verb's own lines, not Bun's `confirm()`/`prompt()`. A verb that cannot promise
// that gets no surface, and the one-shot verbs (`doctor`, `status`/`start`, `crew status`) satisfy
// it trivially — they compute an answer and then draw it once.
//
// The rule is written that way because of how `crew add` failed in the field the first time. It had
// a live leg spinner MIXED with plain `io` writes and Bun's own prompts on the same tty, and the
// report was every way that can go wrong at once — leg lines out of order, the `[y/N]` prompt
// clobbered mid-render, and ✓/spinner statuses landing AFTER the error verdict they were supposed to
// precede. `console` patching moves the tearing around; it does not fix it, because the prompts do
// not go through `console` at all. The fix is not "no surface" — it is **one writer**.
//
// So `crew add` now has a surface, and it holds the whole run: every line it would have printed is
// an {@link AddEvent} instead ({@link plainAdd} replays those as the plain lines, byte for byte),
// every nested write goes through the `Io` the surface hands out, and both questions are answered
// inside the ink app. `cli/remote.ts` swaps `deps.io`, `deps.confirm` and `deps.prompt` for the
// surface's own for the length of the run, which is what makes "nothing else writes" structural.
