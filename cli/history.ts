// ── Why the History link is not there (issue #137) ───────────────────────────
//
// "Show entire history" and the pane's history icon key on ONE boolean the browser is handed:
// `hasSession`. The bridge sets it (`bridge/types.ts` § `toPaneWire`) only when BOTH hold — the pane
// record carries a session ref, and the agent has a journal adapter (`bridge/journal/registry.ts`).
//
// The session ref reaches Herdr from ONE place: the agent-side hook `herdr integration install
// <agent>` writes. That hook exits silently when its environment is not what it expects, and it
// loads at the agent's SESSION START — so installing it under a running agent changes nothing until
// that agent is restarted. Miss any of it and the pane looks perfectly normal while both affordances
// simply are not drawn, with nothing anywhere saying why. `/api/pane/:id/history` is not consulted
// for the hide, so its own `no-log` / `disabled` reasons never get a chance to explain themselves.
//
// This section walks that chain in order — versions, the integration per agent, the interpreter the
// hook needs, what the running bridge actually reports per pane, and where a journal would be read
// from — and every ✗ names the verb that fixes it.
//
// IT STAYS A READ, like everything else in `collie doctor`: `herdr --version`, `herdr integration
// status`, one `which`, one GET of this bridge's own `/api/snapshot`, and `exists`/`list` on the
// journal roots. It installs nothing and restarts nothing.
