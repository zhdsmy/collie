// `stt setup | test | status | off` — the operator's half of speech-to-text (ADR 0029).
//
// ── WHY THIS IS A CLI ACT AND NOT A SETTINGS PAGE ────────────────────────────
// For the reason `collie pair` is one: this surface MINTS OR ACCEPTS A CREDENTIAL. `setup` writes a
// provider key into the state dir, or — on the codex provider — records the operator's consent to put
// somebody else's name on the wire. Neither decision can be authorised by a page loaded over the
// front door; the shell on the host IS the proof, exactly as it is for enrolment (see the header of
// `cli/pairing.ts`). There is no web setup form and there is not going to be one.
//
// ── THE THREE THINGS THIS MODULE OWES THE BRIDGE ─────────────────────────────
//  1. It writes `<stateDir>/stt.json`, and the bridge re-reads that file behind an mtime check
//     (`bridge/stt/config.ts`). So every verb here says "no restart needed" and means it.
//  2. It never re-implements the resolve. `setup` VALIDATES by calling the bridge's own
//     `resolveSttSettings`, `test` loads through it, and `status` reports what it decided — one
//     parser, so a config the CLI calls good can never be a config the bridge calls off.
//  3. It never prints the API key. `status` shows at most the last four characters, and no verb here
//     ever echoes a key back at a terminal that may be logged or shoulder-read.
//
// Reading a key without echo would need a raw-mode tty read this CLI has nowhere else, so `setup`
// does not pretend to have one: the prompt says out loud where the value is about to land.
