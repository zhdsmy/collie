//
// ── EVERY FUNCTION HERE IS PURE ──────────────────────────────────────────────
// Data in, `TonedLine[]` out. `cmdPackStatus` does the probing and the emitting; this module does
// the words, so the whole render matrix — six warrant states, three deposed outcomes, three
// silences — is unit-testable without a store, a clock or a socket.
//
// ── THE TWO PHASES ARE NEVER BLURRED (RFC §5) ────────────────────────────────
// A warrant is **stored** the moment a peer verifies the push, and **anchored** only once that peer
// has restarted and built its listener with the deputy's certificate in its `ca` list. Until then a
// takeover from that peer's side is impossible rather than merely refused, so a surface that printed
// one word for both would be reporting a pack as armed that is not. Each side knows a different half:
//
//   • the PEER knows anchoring exactly — its own process built the listener, and the runtime marker
//     carries the generation it built it from (`bridge/pack/staleness.ts`);
//   • the LEAD knows storage exactly — every member reports its generation on `hello` — and learns
//     activation the same way since §18.17: `warrantActiveGeneration`, reported by the machine that
//     did it. `pack-ops.json`'s "did I restart that machine over ssh" survives as the fallback for a
//     member that is not answering, or is too old to say. Preferring the report is the fix for a live
//     drill in which the lead told the operator to restart a deputy that was already fully armed.
//
// ── ONE SILENCE CLOCK (RFC §10.1) ────────────────────────────────────────────
// The threshold this file prints against is the arming formula itself, because §10.1's rule is that
// the deputy's door and the peer's status line read the same number. A door that arms on a fact
// `pack status` does not print is a door nobody can explain.

/**
 * The deputy holds paired devices of its own under labels the lead is syncing (§18.14).
 *
 * **It is a finding, not a refusal, and the difference is security-relevant.** The sync itself always
 * lands — a live drill found that refusing it froze the deputy's copy, so a device revoked on the
 * lead stayed valid at that machine's standby door for ever. What the collision refuses is the
 * ADOPTION: the takeover, where those entries would enter a registry under a name, and where a
 * silently renamed device is one the operator could not revoke by the name they know it by (RFC §16,
 * decision 6).
 *
 * It is the lead's operator who can fix it — the labels are theirs — so the finding is printed here
 * and nowhere else. Read off the runtime marker because it is an observation of one process's
 * traffic, and re-derived by the deputy on every answer, so it appears while it is true and clears
 * the moment the name is freed, with no verb and no restart.
