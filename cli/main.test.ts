// ── THE REGRESSION PIN ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `collie build` is what runs `bun install`, so everything that reaches it has to run with no
// dependencies installed at all: `scripts/collie-ctl.sh` builds the binary from source on a fresh
// `herdr plugin install` checkout, and `crew add`'s install leg runs the same from-source build on a
// checkout `git fetch` has just advanced past its `node_modules`. That invariant was live but
// unpinned, and a top-level `import { Command } from "commander"` in this module's ancestor broke it
// in the field: every such install died with `Cannot find package 'commander'` before a line of
// Collie ran.
//
// So the invariant is asserted structurally rather than by executing a build in a sandbox: walk the
// STATIC import graph from `cli/main.ts` and require every specifier in it to be a builtin or a
// repo-relative file. Dynamic `import()` edges are deliberately not followed — being behind one is
// exactly what makes a package (commander, ink, react, web-push, qrcode-terminal) safe to depend on
// here, because the specifier is only resolved if that branch runs.
