// `collie beacon emit` — the agent's own hook, telling Collie what only the agent knows.
//
// Claude Code runs this on five of its own events (`cli/hooks.ts` registers them) with the event
// payload as JSON on stdin. It writes ONE file: the beacon for the pane it is running in
// (`bridge/beacon/`). Nothing it writes is ever obeyed — a beacon is a hint, never a control channel
// (.adr/0024).
//
// ── TWO CLAUDE-CODE HAZARDS, AND BOTH ARE ABSOLUTE ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A `UserPromptSubmit` hook's STDOUT IS INJECTED INTO THE CONVERSATION as context, and a NON-ZERO
// EXIT BLOCKS THE PROMPT. So this verb prints nothing — not to stdout, not to stderr — and returns
// `EXIT.OK` on every path there is: no multiplexer, malformed JSON, an unwritable state dir, a full
// disk. A beacon that fails to write is a beacon that is ABSENT, which the reader already handles
// honestly; an emitter that can wedge the operator's agent is worse than no emitter at all.
//
// `SessionEnd` runs on a 1.5 s default budget, which sets the shape of the work: one environment
// read, one parse, one `/proc` read for the pid's start time, one atomic write. No network, no
// subprocess, and nothing that can block on another process.
//
// ── THE PAYLOAD, AS CAPTURED (2026-08-20, `claude -p` under a throwaway CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR) ─────────
//
//   UserPromptSubmit  session_id, transcript_path, cwd, prompt, prompt_id, permission_mode,
//                     hook_event_name
//   SessionEnd        session_id, transcript_path, cwd, prompt_id, hook_event_name,
//                     reason (observed: "other")
//
// `SessionStart` carries the same common fields — `session_id` among them (code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks.md,
// read 2026-08-25) — plus `source`, which says how the session started.
//
// `Stop` (adds `stop_hook_active`, `last_assistant_message`) and `Notification` (adds
// `notification_type`, `message`) were not reached by the headless probe — a `-p` run completes
// without either, and `idle_prompt` fires ~60 s after a response in an INTERACTIVE session only.
// Their field lists are the documented ones (code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks.md, read 2026-08-20), and
// this verb reads neither: `hook_event_name` and `session_id` are the only fields it touches.
// `agent_id` (present only for a SUBAGENT's events) was absent from every captured payload, which is
// the case the gate below is for.
//
// The probe also settled the pid question: a hook command runs as a DIRECT CHILD of the `claude`
// process — no surviving shell in between, with or without a trailing comment in the command string —
// so `process.ppid` is the agent, and the agent is what the reader's liveness check needs. The hook's
// own pid is dead microseconds later and would make every beacon read expired.

 * One Claude Code hook event, and what it says the agent is doing.

 * ── THE MAP IS PASEO'S, VERBATIM (getpaseo/paseo) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Its three-state event map is the one part of paseo that transfers to a Collie that adopts panes it
 * did not spawn, and it is reproduced here row for row rather than re-derived:
 *
 *   `UserPromptSubmit` → working · `Stop` → idle · `SessionEnd` → idle ·
 *   `Notification`/`idle_prompt` → waiting
 *
 * `SessionStart` → idle is the ONE row that is ours and not paseo's, and it was earned live: four
 * Claudes sat in four zellij panes with an empty beacons directory, because none of them had been
 * asked anything yet, so Collie reported every one of them as a shell — "No agents running" over a
 * screen full of agents. A launched agent IS an agent; the first prompt is not what makes it one.
 * The row says `idle` because that is what a session with no turn in it is doing, and `idle` is the
 * word `Stop` already uses for it.
 *
 * NOTHING BRANCHES ON `source`. `SessionStart` fires on startup, on `--resume`, on `/clear`, on a
 * compaction and on a fork; all five mean "an agent sits here, idle", and none of them changes the
 * pane key — the beacon is keyed by the pane, so a later event simply overwrites the same file. It is
 * registered with no matcher for that reason: every source is the same sentence.
 *
 * THE MATCHER IS THE WAITING SIGNAL, NEVER A MESSAGE STRING. `Notification` fires for several
 * notification types; the registration in `cli/hooks.ts` carries `matcher: "idle_prompt"`, so the
 * only `Notification` payloads that reach this process are the idle ones. The `idle_prompt` message
 * string is undocumented and nothing here parses it — a status derived from prose is a status that
 * changes when the prose does.
