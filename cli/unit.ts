// ── Windows: the Task Scheduler task ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The third service definition, kept parallel to the two above so all three describe ONE service:
//   WantedBy=default.target -> LogonTrigger (this user)    Restart=on-failure -> the launcher's loop
//   RestartSec=5            -> the launcher's 5 s pause     WorkingDirectory   -> WorkingDirectory
// The launcher is `collie _supervise` (cli/task-scheduler.ts), because Task Scheduler restarts a task
// that failed to START, not a program that exits: something Collie owns has to watch the bridge.
//
// TWO RESTART LAYERS, AND WHICH ONE WINS. The launcher's loop owns relaunching the bridge: it sees
// every exit and backs off on its own clock. `RestartOnFailure` (999 tries, one minute apart) never
// sees the bridge, and it is a narrower net than it looks. Measured on the Windows 11 VM on
// 2026-10-02: a launcher killed by hand takes its bridge with it (a child that is not detached dies
// with its parent), `conhost` then exits 0, the task reads Ready with result 0, and nothing restarts
// it in 160 s. So it covers a task that fails to START, not a launcher that dies. A dead launcher comes
// back with the 5-minute time trigger below, at the next logon, or with `collie restart` (which sees
// no live launcher and takes stop + start).
//
// THE SETTINGS THAT ARE NOT DEFAULTS, each pinned by `cli/unit.test.ts`:
//   ExecutionTimeLimit PT0S        the default is 72 hours, after which Task Scheduler silently ends
//                                  the supervisor and the bridge stops being watched
//   MultipleInstancesPolicy IgnoreNew  a second `/Run` while one runs is a no-op, never a second launcher
//   DisallowStartIfOnBatteries false, StopIfGoingOnBatteries false  a laptop on battery keeps its bridge
//   StartWhenAvailable true        a logon that was missed (the task disabled at the time) runs later
//   TimeTrigger every 5 minutes    a launcher killed by hand comes back within 5 minutes. With
//                                  IgnoreNew the trigger does nothing while the launcher runs, and
//                                  `collie stop` disables the task, so a stopped Collie stays stopped
// No analogue: NoNewPrivileges and PrivateTmp. The task runs with the user's limited token unless
// the operator asks for `COLLIE_TASK_RUN_LEVEL=highest` (see `taskRunLevel` in cli/lifecycle.ts).
