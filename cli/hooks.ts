// `collie hooks install claude` / `uninstall claude` / `status` — putting the beacon emitter into the
// agent's own settings, and taking it back out.
//
// ── THE SCOPE IS GLOBAL, AND THAT IS THE MILESTONE'S PREMISE ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// The targets are `~/.claude/settings.json` and the same file in every `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` profile
// the journal registry already knows about (issue #92). PROJECT SETTINGS ARE NEVER WRITTEN — not
// `.claude/settings.json`, not `.claude/settings.local.json`. The operator adopts panes *anywhere on
// the host*, so a per-project install would make a pane's identity depend on which directory the
// agent happened to be started in, which is precisely the fragility beacons exist to remove. The cost
// of the global scope is one process spawn per hook event outside a multiplexer, and `beacon emit`'s
// environment gate makes that cost nothing.
//
// ── THREE GUARDS, EACH EARNED FROM A REAL FAILURE (Ark0N/Codeman) ─────────────────────────────────
//
//  1. MERGE BY A VERSION-PREFIXED OWNERSHIP MARKER. Claude Code merges hook entries across settings
//     levels rather than replacing them, so an operator's own hooks sit in the same arrays as ours.
//     Every entry we write carries {@link HOOK_MARKER}; an entry without one is never touched, read
//     or reordered, and `uninstall` removes only marked entries. A marker at a DIFFERENT version is
//     replaced in place — that is the self-heal, and it is why the version is in the marker at all.
//  2. REFUSE A SYMLINKED SETTINGS FILE; RESOLVE A SYMLINKED SETTINGS DIRECTORY. A rename onto a
//     symlinked FILE (home-manager's read-only Nix store profile) replaces the link with a plain
//     file — an installer editing something the operator did not mean — so that still refuses. A
//     symlinked DIRECTORY (stow, chezmoi pointing the whole `~/.claude` elsewhere) is not the same
//     shape: every write inside it lands in the real directory, exactly how `open`/`rename` already
//     resolve every non-final path component, so refusing it bought nothing but a false alarm
//     (issue #190). {@link realpathVia} resolves it instead, and the write happens at the real path
//     underneath; only a directory link that resolves to NOTHING, or to somewhere this process
//     cannot write, is refused — worded in one line, never a raw filesystem error.
//  3. WRITE ATOMICALLY, AND BACK UP ONCE. Temp file plus rename, and a `.collie-backup` beside the
//     file before the first modification, so a bad merge is one `mv` from undone.
//
// Installing twice changes no bytes: the second run serialises the same document and writes nothing.
// "Already installed" is decided by COMPARING THE BYTES, never by finding a marker and stopping — so
// when a registration joins {@link BEACON_HOOKS} (as `SessionStart` did), the next `hooks install`
// adds that one event to a file that already carries the others, leaves every entry beside it where
// it was, and is a no-op on the run after. That is why growing the set needs no marker bump: the
// version says what the COMMAND looks like, and the command did not change. The same rule healed an
// entry installed before `timeout: 10` existed: `ourGroup` always rebuilds the whole entry object, so
// an old one missing the field gets it back the next time bytes are compared — no marker bump, because
// the command string is still exactly what it was.

 * install runs from `<root>/versions/X.Y.Z/bin/collie`, and `update` keeps only the previous version

 *     `<root>/versions/X.Y.Z/bin/collie` — the same file under two names, and a string comparison
 *     calls them different (the whole cause of the dangling-hook bug).
 *  2. Whatever {@link publishedBinary} says this install publishes — `<root>/current/bin/collie` on a
