//
// ── READ-ONLY IS THE CONTRACT, NOT A GUIDELINE ───────────────────────────────
// Nothing here writes a file, touches a service, mutates a store or publishes/tears down a front
// door. That is what makes `doctor` safe to run on a machine that is already misbehaving — a
// diagnostic that "helpfully" fixes something has changed the evidence before you read it. It is
// enforced structurally rather than by care: {@link DoctorDeps} names no lifecycle verb, no audit
// log and no mutating store method, so there is nothing to call.
//
// ── IT REUSES `pack status`'s PROBES ─────────────────────────────────────────
// `deriveMode`, `bindIsWildcard`, `probeMembers`, `parseMarker`/`rosterDrift` (the two pure halves
// `reportDrift` itself prints from), `tailnetInboundBlocked`, and `serve.ts`'s ownership parsing are
// all imported, never re-derived. A second implementation of a probe is a second thing to drift, and
// a doctor that disagrees with `pack status` is worse than no doctor.
//
// ── EVERY FINDING NAMES A VERB ───────────────────────────────────────────────
// Each check is one line with a status and, unless it passed, the remedy. "Something is wrong"
// without a verb is not a finding — the whole value of this verb is that each of these traps
// currently announces itself as something else (a loopback bind reads as "the lead can't reach the
// peer", a deny-all ACL as "server down", clock skew as a 401, a rebuilt-not-restarted bridge as "my
// change didn't take").

// The finding type and its four constructors live in `cli/finding.ts`, so a check can be written in
// its own module without importing this verb. Re-exported here because `Finding` is `doctor`'s own
// public shape and every caller and test already imports it from this file.

//    will ever install the emitter and a red line here would exit this verb non-zero on a perfectly
//    healthy machine. An operator who learns to ignore one red line ignores the next. `ok`.
//  • Absent (tmux, zellij) — the emitter is the ONLY thing that can give that adapter sight
//    (`beaconMatcher`, M11/03). Without it every pane reads as a shell: no agent list, no "needs
//    you", no notification. That is not a degraded Collie, it is the feature missing. `error`.
//
// The name is never read here. A fourth multiplexer inherits the right tier from its own declaration.
