//
// ── COURIER AND INSTALLER, NOTHING ELSE ──────────────────────────────────────
// Every step here is a step the operator could have typed, in the same order, with the same verbs:
// the invite comes from the same `mintInvite` path `pack invite` uses, and the far machine runs the
// same `collie join <lead-address> -`. `pack add` adds NO route, no header and no protocol
// vocabulary (ADR 0015 (d)) — an installer that needed the protocol's help would be a second
// admission path into the pack, and the pack has exactly one (PACK_PROTOCOL.md §8.2).
//
// ── THIS IS THE ONLY MODULE THAT SPAWNS `ssh` ────────────────────────────────
// {@link RemoteRunner} is the seam, injected exactly as `PackDeps` injects `fetch`, `exec` and
// `files`, so no test in this suite ever reaches a real host. The ssh options are **add-only**: the
// operator's `~/.ssh/config` and `known_hosts` are ridden rather than reimplemented, and no
// host-key-checking option is ever set, in either direction (ADR 0015's consequences).
//
// ── EVERYTHING GOES OVER STDIN ───────────────────────────────────────────────
// Each leg is a `/bin/sh -s` script written to ssh's stdin — no `curl | sh`, no login shell, no
// assumption that anything is on `PATH` (tools are resolved the way `scripts/collie-ctl.sh` resolves
// Bun, and each script reports rather than fixes). The bundle and the enrollment token ride the SAME
// stream, spliced into a quoted heredoc at {@link STDIN_MARKER}, which is what keeps the token out
// of argv, out of the environment and out of every golden file (§8.3).
