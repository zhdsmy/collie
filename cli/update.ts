// `update`, `_apply-update` and the checkout logic behind them, ported from
// the pre-shim `collie-ctl.sh`. ADR 0006 is this module's specification: Collie is a link-mode
// Herdr plugin, so the checkout on disk IS the plugin, and it arrives in one of TWO shapes —
//
//   `git clone` + `herdr plugin link`   → a normal clone, ON A BRANCH, full history
//   `herdr plugin install AltanS/collie` → `git init` + `fetch --depth 1` + `checkout --detach`,
//                                          i.e. DETACHED and SHALLOW, no remote-tracking refs
//
// — and a bare `git pull --ff-only` has nothing to pull into in the second, which is why every
// turnkey install from 0.1.0 to 0.23.1 could never self-update while the in-app banner kept
// advertising the release (#63).
//
// SINCE M15/02 the first of those two shapes no longer advances in place: a linked clone STAGES its
// update into a `versions/vX.Y.Z` git worktree and goes live by flipping a `current` symlink, the
// same layout and the same single rename a binary install uses. ADR 0006's 2026-09-03 amendment
// records the change and scopes it: a Herdr-managed checkout keeps advancing in place. See "The

  //     older commit. Now `isReleaseBuild` compares it against HEAD, they differ, and a genuine
  //     release is stamped `<version>-dev`. Measured in the VM lab on a guest whose clone carried an

  //     `X-Collie-Build` header then call a release a development build, and `cli/pack-update.ts`'s
  //     `answersThisBuild` reads the `-dev` tail as "not that commit" — so a pack member updated
  //     this way looks like it never took the push it did take.

  // Storing the ref replaces absent-or-stale with true, in both shapes.

// `--rollback` almost free.
//
// The running bridge is pinned to the version directory it was started from — `process.execPath` is
// realpath-resolved, so `resolvePluginRoot` returns `versions/X.Y.Z`, never `current` — so it keeps
// serving its own `web/dist` until the restart. There is no instant at which a new binary serves an
// old bundle or the reverse (`cli/install-kind.test.ts` pins that assumption).

// run the NEW build logic and the new binary does not exist yet; here nothing is compiled and the

// from a staged checkout with no special case.
