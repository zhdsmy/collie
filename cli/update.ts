  //     `answersThisBuild` reads the `-dev` tail as "not that commit" — so a pack member updated
  //     this way looks like it never took the push it did take.
  //
  // Storing the ref replaces absent-or-stale with true, in both shapes.
  // The leading `+` forces the update. It is the right sign HERE and only here: this function

// manifest, `package.json`, `.env.example`, `docs/`), and `<root>/current` is a RELATIVE symlink at

// two atomic renames, and the previous version is still on disk afterwards, which is what makes
// `--rollback` almost free.
//
// The running bridge is pinned to the version directory it was started from — `process.execPath` is
// realpath-resolved, so `resolvePluginRoot` returns `versions/X.Y.Z`, never `current` — so it keeps
// serving its own `web/dist` until the restart. There is no instant at which a new binary serves an
// old bundle or the reverse (`cli/install-kind.test.ts` pins that assumption).
//
// Nothing here re-execs. `cmdUpdate`'s `_apply-update` handoff exists because the source path must
// run the NEW build logic and the new binary does not exist yet; here nothing is compiled and the
// old binary can perform every step.
