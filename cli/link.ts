// `collie link` / `collie unlink` — publish the checkout's compiled binary under a name on the
// operator's PATH, and take it back.
//
// ── A POINTER, NEVER A COPY ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
// What lands in `~/.local/bin` is a SYMLINK to `<checkout>/bin/collie`, and the reasoning for that —
// rather than a copied binary or a wrapper script — is
// [ADR 0021](../.adr/0021-the-path-name-is-a-pointer-never-a-copy.md). The one fact this module
// depends on: `build` compiles to `bin/collie.new` and RENAMES it into place (cli/build.ts), so the
// path a symlink resolves is replaced atomically underneath it. The link never needs refreshing, and
// there is no second artifact to keep in step.
//
// ── ONLY EVER TEAR DOWN WHAT MATCHES YOUR OWN RECORD ─────────────────────────
// ADR 0001's rule, applied to a name instead of a front door. Here the "record" is the destination's
// SHAPE: a symlink whose target is some checkout's `bin/collie` is a name Collie published, so `link`
// may replace it (loudly, naming what it pointed at). Anything else — a regular file, a directory, a
// symlink into someone else's tool — is refused untouched. `unlink` is stricter still: it removes the
// name only when it points at THIS checkout's binary, because a link to another checkout belongs to
// that instance.
//
// Nothing here edits a shell profile. Publishing a name is one act; changing how the operator's shell
// is configured is another, and a verb that quietly rewrote `.bashrc` would be the second.
