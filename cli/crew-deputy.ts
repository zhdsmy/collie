// `collie crew deputy <member>` / `--revoke` — the operator names the ONE peer that may take the
// crown, and arms it (RFC §3, §4.4, §5; CREW_PROTOCOL.md §18).
//
// ── IT IS A MEMBERSHIP VERB, SO IT WRITES AND RESTARTS ───────────────────────
// The warrant is minted by `mintWarrant` (`bridge/crew/warrant.ts`) and committed through
// `commitCrewChange`, exactly like every other membership change — this module holds argument
// parsing, ordering, and the words an operator reads, and decides nothing about what a trust store
// should contain. Then it restarts the LOCAL bridge, because a collie reads its trust store at most
// once per process (§8.1's 2026-08-07 amendment): a verb that only wrote the file would leave the
// running lead issuing a warrant it has never heard of.
//
// ── ARMING IS TWO PHASES, AND THE SECOND IS A RESTART ON ANOTHER MACHINE ─────
// A peer's listener is built with `ca: [<its lead's certificate>]` and `server.reload({tls})` does
// not swap a pinned `ca` (`bridge/crew/transport.ts`). So a warrant that lands on a peer is **inert
// at the transport until that peer restarts** — a takeover from there is impossible, not merely
// refused. That makes the restart load-bearing rather than tidy, which is why this verb performs it
// rather than printing it (RFC §16, decision 7).
//
// ── OVER THE OPERATOR'S OWN SSH, NEVER THE CREW WIRE (ADR 0015/0016) ─────────
// Same channel `crew add` and `crew update` use, same leg scripts, same remembered route in
// `crew-ops.json`. The crew link carries runtime data and is not a control channel; a lead that
// could restart a peer down it would be a reboot credential on every machine it leads.
//
// ── ONE CONSENT FOR THE BATCH, AND NO `--yes` ────────────────────────────────
// Every target is probed read-only first, then the whole operation is confirmed once — `crew
// update`'s shape, for `crew update`'s reason: asking five times is not five consents, it is one
// consent with four chances to answer wrong by reflex. A restart is also the least disruptive remote
// act in this CLI's repertoire — it moves no code and drops one poll. Non-interactive aborts
// legibly; there is deliberately no flag that skips the question.

 * sign warrant pushes with the same key — the running bridge's sweep (`lead.ts` → `distributeWarrant`)

 * of a stamp the peer has already burned. That is a **stamp** problem, not a permission one, and

 *     simply have got there first, which is a race won, not a failure;

 *   • it does not answer — it is **not there**. Unreachable, and the sweep will deliver on its next
