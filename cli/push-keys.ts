// `collie push-keys` (also spelled `collie push keys`) — generate the VAPID keypair Web Push needs
// and write it into the plugin .env, the step that used to be "find the web-push CLI, run it,
// hand-edit a file you've never opened, in a directory you had to go looking for".
//
// A verb in `cli/`, not shell in the bootstrap shim: every verb is implemented ONCE here and
// compiled into `bin/collie` (ADR 0006). The Herdr action still spells
// `bash scripts/collie-ctl.sh push-keys` because those command strings are frozen — the shim
// delegates it here like every other verb, and the config dir is `CliContext`'s, resolved exactly
// the same way `start`, `serve` and `push test` resolve it. That single resolution is the whole
// point of the verb: the .env it writes is the .env the service reads.
//
// ── WHY THIS DOESN'T USE `web-push` ──────────────────────────────────────────
// `web-push` ships `generateVAPIDKeys()`, but it is an OPTIONAL dependency (bridge/push.ts imports
// it lazily so a checkout without it still runs). Keygen is step one of turning push on; failing it
// because the sender isn't installed yet would put the operator back in exactly the "which package do
// I need" hole this verb exists to fill. A VAPID keypair is a plain P-256 keypair — the public half
// is the uncompressed point (0x04‖X‖Y) and the private half is the scalar `d`, both base64url — so
// node:crypto produces the identical thing with no dependency at all. We still *check* for web-push
// at the end and say so, because keys without a sender are a service that starts up and pushes
// nothing.
