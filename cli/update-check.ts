//
// ── IT ANSWERS ONE QUESTION AND CHANGES NOTHING ──────────────────────────────
// "Can an update succeed here right now?" Nothing in this module writes a file, restarts a unit,
// flips `current`, fetches into a checkout or touches config. Every probe is a read, which is what
// makes it safe to poll from the phone (spec 05) and safe to ask before a pack flow acts (spec 06).
// The rule is structural, the same way `cli/doctor.ts` enforces it: the deps below name no
// lifecycle verb, no writer and no mutating store method, so there is nothing here to call.
//
// ── IT RE-USES, IT DOES NOT RE-DERIVE ────────────────────────────────────────
// The target is `cli/update.ts`'s own planner (`planUpdate` over `parseRemoteTags`/`parseApiTags`),
// the install kind is `cli/install-kind.ts`'s, the per-instance diagnosis is `collie doctor`'s
// findings, and a member is reached with `cli/remote.ts`'s probe script over the operator's ssh
// (ADR 0016). A second implementation of a probe is a second thing to drift.
//
// ── EVERY RED NAMES ITS REASON ───────────────────────────────────────────────
// `cli/doctor.ts` argues this twice in its own comments: a warning that fires on a healthy host
// trains the operator to ignore it. So a red here is specific — it names the files, the host, the
// unit or the remote — and anything merely worth knowing (version skew, an unusual install kind, a
// major that is out) is AMBER, which never blocks.
