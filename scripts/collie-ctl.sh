# Bootstrap shim for Collie. Its ONLY job: make sure `bin/collie` exists, then hand it the argv.
#
# Every verb — start/stop/restart/build/serve/unserve/status/url/qr/version/update/_apply-update/
# _exec-bridge/uninstall/push-keys/push-test/logs and the pack verbs — is implemented ONCE, in `cli/`, and
# compiled into `bin/collie` (M6/01). Nothing about a systemd unit, a launchd agent, `tailscale
# serve` or a git checkout lives here any more; if you are about to add such a thing, it belongs in
# `cli/`.
#
# Why the plugin's actions still name this script instead of the binary: `herdr-plugin.toml`'s
# `command` strings are FROZEN. On Herdr <0.8.0 a managed install invokes the action set cached at
# install time, so the path in that cache must keep working (ADR 0006) — and README recipes and
# muscle memory spell every verb `collie-ctl.sh <verb>`. Delegating keeps all three true, and gives
# a checkout with no binary yet ONE legible path to getting one.
#
# `update` runs through here like any other verb, and nothing here has to survive it: the shim
# bootstraps (if needed) and `exec`s the binary, whose `cmdUpdate` advances the checkout and then
# re-execs `bun cli/main.ts _apply-update` FROM THE FETCHED SOURCE (cli/update.ts) — so the code that
# rebuilds is always the code that was just pulled, and this file is out of the picture by then.

#
# This survived the port because it is the BOOTSTRAP's job, not the CLI's: Bun is what compiles the
# binary, so it has to be found before there is a binary to do the finding. Herdr spawns plugin
# actions with a minimal environment — no login shell, so nothing has sourced the line `bun` puts in
# your profile and `~/.bun/bin` is simply absent from PATH. `update` therefore pulled the new commit
# and then failed its build, leaving the checkout AHEAD of the web/dist being served while every
# version string reported the new release — unnoticed across four invocations.
#
# The candidate list is not this file's own. It is the canonical one `cli/sys.ts` defines
# (`toolCandidates`) and `cli/remote.ts`'s `TOOL_LOOKUP` also spells; `cli/sys.test.ts` parses
# this function and fails when the three disagree. Add a candidate in all three or in none.
