# The Windows test suites, in ONE place. CI (`windows` job in ci.yml) and the Windows VM
# (`make win-test`, guest-test.ps1 in the workspace) both call this file, so they cannot drift.
#
# The caller gets the code, the toolchain and `bun install` ready. This script does none of that.
# It runs `bun test` over bridge, cli and scripts, and prints one line per suite. Exit 0 means: no
# failing test, and no suite with more skipped tests than its own budget allows. Any other result
# exits 1.
#
# Works in Windows PowerShell 5.1 and in PowerShell 7.
#
#   -Out       where the logs go: <suite>.log and <suite>.fails per suite (one failing name per line)
#   -MaxSkipsBridge, -MaxSkipsCli, -MaxSkipsScripts
#              the most skipped tests that still count as green, PER SUITE, so a new skip in one suite
#              cannot hide behind a removed one in another. A test must not be skipped just to get
#              green, so a higher count is a failure. Raise a number only with a reason.
#              Bridge went from 2 to 0 when M43 spec 04 checked the access list instead of the mode.
#              Today, 28 in all, each one named, with its reason:
#              bridge 4, in bridge/stt/local-cli.test.ts. Windows has no executable bit and no file
#                owner check in this provider:
#                - "commandFileProblem: regular executable passes, symlinks are followed" (the
#                  executable bit; a symlink needs a privilege on Windows)
#                - "status refuses a directory and a non-executable file, and names neither" (the
#                  executable bit)
#                - "only an old directory with the prefix, owned by this user, is removed" (the
#                  owner check by uid)
#                - "loading the provider sweeps its temp root once, in the background" (without a
#                  uid the sweep removes nothing on Windows, so there is nothing to see)
#              cli 1: "a per-call override wins over the Exec's own environment (#283) > a child
#                killed by a signal says which one" (Windows has no POSIX signals)
#              scripts 23: every test of scripts/install.test.ts ("scripts/install.sh > ..."):
#                install.sh is POSIX sh, and Windows installs with install.ps1, tested beside it.
