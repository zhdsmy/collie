# Collie's installer — download the release for this platform, verify its sha256, lay it down, put
# `collie` on PATH.
#
# This file is curl-piped into a shell AND read by people who will not run what they have not read,
# so it is deliberately one page of POSIX sh with no helpers to go and find. What it will never do:
# ask for sudo, write outside $COLLIE_DIR and ~/.local/bin, start a service, or send anything
# anywhere. It ends by PRINTING the next three steps rather than taking them — choosing a
# multiplexer and seeding a config are the operator's decisions, and a script that guesses them
# guesses wrong (docs/install.md spells out the same steps by hand, for exactly this reason).
#
# It is a convenience, never the only door. Every asset it fetches — tarball, `.sha256` sidecar,
# release manifest — is a plain GitHub Release file you can download and check by hand; the commands
# to do that are in docs/install.md, and this script does nothing they do not.
#
# Three environment variables steer it, and nothing else does: COLLIE_DIR (where to install),
# COLLIE_UPDATE_REPO (which repo to fetch from), and COLLIE_TAG (install one exact release tag, e.g.
# COLLIE_TAG=v1.0.0-beta.49). A pin skips the tag lookup completely — no call to api.github.com — so
# it is both the way to ask for an older version on purpose and the way back onto a known-good one
# when an install is stuck. It is an environment variable rather than an option because `curl … | sh`
# gives options to the shell, not to this script.

# ── What is left, which is yours ─────────────────────────────────────────────
cat <<EOF

✓ Collie $TAG is installed at $DIR — and nothing is running yet.

Three steps left, and each one is a decision:

  1. Seed the config:
       mkdir -p ~/.config/collie
       cp $DIR/current/.env.example ~/.config/collie/.env

  2. Name your multiplexer in that file — COLLIE_MUX=herdr, tmux or zellij. Leave it out and the
     first \`collie start\` probes for one and asks you.
     Herdr needs its server running; tmux and zellij need an endpoint naming which server or
     session to mirror. Both walkthroughs: $DIR/current/docs/multiplexers.md

  3. Start it, and read the banner it prints:
       collie start

Read $DIR/current/docs/security.md before you open the URL on a phone. A Collie is remote shell
access to your machine, by design.
