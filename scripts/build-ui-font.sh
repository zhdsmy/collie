# Rebuild the bundled UI typeface subsets in web/public/fonts/.
#
# NOT part of the build, for the same reason scripts/build-nerd-font.sh is not: a webfont is a
# release artifact, not a build step. This needs Python + fonttools + brotli, and the .woff2 files
# are committed.
#
# TWO KINDS OF CANDIDATE LIVE IN THE LIST BELOW, and the difference is not cosmetic.
#
#   * SHIPPED faces are the ones the app can actually be set to — the Typeface card in Settings
#     offers exactly these, and web/src/index.css declares exactly these. index.css MIRRORS the
#     shipped list: a face is shipped when it has an @font-face block, a computed fallback twin and
#     an entry in UI_FONT_URLS (web/src/lib/sw-routes.ts). Today: space-grotesk, aldrich (the
#     default), and geist. Adding one means all four edits; web/src/fonts.test.ts pins them.
#   * PLAYGROUND-ONLY auditions are candidates on disk that nothing in the app names. They exist so
#     the "UI typeface" playground card can put a face beside the shipped ones at real sizes before
#     anyone argues for it. Today: ibm-plex-sans. An audition that never wins is deleted —
#     its .woff2 and its LICENSE go together.
#
# The app face was the maker's choice when this script was written; it is a per-device setting now
# (ADR 0033). That widened what "shipped" means and changed nothing about how a face is BUILT.
#
# Unlike the Nerd Font faces, the UI face is on the critical path — it dresses every label in the
# app — so the whole job here is making it small and making its metrics knowable:
#
#   * INSTANCE first. Pin every axis the app does not use (wdth, opsz) and clamp wght to 400–700.
#     The design uses two weights (500 / 600); 400–700 leaves room without carrying 100–900.
#   * SUBSET second. Latin + Latin-Ext-A + the punctuation the app actually prints. The ja/ko/zh
#     dictionaries are deliberately NOT covered: no sane build ships a CJK webfont, and those
#     locales fall through to the system face, which is what they should do.
#   * KEEP `tnum`. Every count in the app is `tabular-nums`; dropping the feature would silently
#     turn "14m (6) p1" back into proportional figures.
#   * PRINT the fallback metric overrides. index.css declares a metric-matched stand-in per face so
#     the swap moves nothing (see its @font-face block). Those numbers are DERIVED, not chosen —
#     this script recomputes them so a font bump cannot leave them stale.
#
#   pip install 'fonttools[woff]'
#   scripts/build-ui-font.sh

# The last field is either a (possibly empty) list of "axis=value" pins for a VARIABLE face, or the
# literal token `static` for a face that carries no `fvar` at all. Aldrich is the static case: there
# is no instancer step to run, so the TTF is copied to the instance name the subsetter and the
# metrics pass below both expect. Everything after that — subset, features, fallback twin — is
# identical, which is the point of spelling the branch here rather than forking the loop.
#
# See the header for which of these are SHIPPED and which are playground-only auditions.
