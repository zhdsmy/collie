# The harness canary

`bun run canary` starts claude, codex, opencode and pi in a Herdr session of its own, types drafts
and a few real sends, and checks with Collie's own code what the phone would read and whether each
send lands. It then reads the session each agent WROTE, with the bridge's own journal adapter, and
fails on a row or content type the reader does not recognise. With `--dialogs` it also opens real
dialogs and sends to a busy agent. Specs: M37/02, M37/03 and M41/05 in the workspace tracker.

```sh
bun run canary                          # all four agents, the six default scenarios
bun run canary --dialogs                # plus dialogs and busy (more model turns)
bun run canary --agent codex,claude --scenario cards # current card screens, one seed turn each
bun run canary --agent claude,codex     # some agents
bun run canary --scenario idle,drafts   # some scenarios, no model turns
bun run canary --keep                   # leave the session up for a look
bun run canary --record                 # write clean agents into the ledger
bun run canary --readers /tmp/c1131     # judge with another checkout's readers
```

Exit 1 means a scenario failed. Captures and `summary.json` go to
`/tmp/collie-canary/<run-id>/<agent>-<version>/`. They are never copied into `web/src/fixtures/`.

## What it checks

Six scenarios per agent. Only `sends` makes model turns: four per agent.

| id           | what the canary does                                          | what must hold                                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `idle`       | starts the agent and waits for Herdr's idle                   | composer ready (adapter agents), raw blocks, no card   |
| `drafts`     | types the 15 message kinds, never submits them                | the draft reads back, composer ready, no card          |
| `sends`      | sends plain, a `────` rule, Chinese and one file read         | outcome `sent`, the message and an OK below it         |
| `journal`    | reads the session those sends wrote, with the journal adapter | a user item, a tool item, a reply, nothing unrecognised |
| `narrow`     | restarts at 50 columns, idle plus two drafts                  | the same as `idle` and `drafts`                        |
| `start-exit` | samples every 150 ms while starting and after exiting         | no unread card                                         |

The message kinds live in `messages.ts`: the 14 hand kinds of 2026-09-26, plus `15-rule`, a
pasted `────` line. claude, codex and opencode are read with their adapters. pi has no adapter. For
it a draft passes when its words show on the raw mirror, and a send goes through the one-step path
the phone uses.

### The journal (spec M41/05)

`journal` is the only scenario that reads something other than a screen: what the phone's Chat mode
would make of the agent's OWN session log. It costs no model turn of its own, and it has nothing to
read unless `sends` ran in the same pane, which is why the two sit next to each other.

Two gates. The ITEM KINDS: the adapter must yield a user item carrying a prompt the canary itself
typed, a tool item, and a reply below the prompt. The UNKNOWNS: every reducer counts the row kinds
and content kinds it had no branch for (`bridge/journal/reduce.ts`), and the run fails above zero,
naming the type. That second one is a gate against a format change nobody has written a test for.

- **Nothing is saved, not even under `/tmp`.** The screen scenarios write an `.ansi` capture per
  case; a session log may not be written anywhere, because a Claude JSONL carries file contents from
  every Read and environment from every Bash. Only counts and item kinds reach `summary.json`.
- **The session comes off the PANE RECORD** (`agent_session`), exactly as the bridge's history route
  takes it. The canary never picks the newest file in a root: that would be reading somebody else's
  session.
- **Every way of having nothing to read is `not-reached`**, never a fail: no journal adapter for the
  agent, no session reported (Codex reports only once its first prompt is submitted, and every agent
  needs `herdr integration install <agent>`), a ref that resolves to no log, or a model that
  answered in words and opened no tool call at all.
- **The fourth send asks for a file READ, not a shell command.** Claude Code asks before Bash in its
  default mode, so "run `echo`" would park the pane on a permission dialog with nobody to answer it.
  The file is the `README.md` that `freshProject()` commits.
- **A `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` in this process's environment becomes a journal root.** Herdr's panes
  inherit that variable, so the Claude in a pane writes into that profile's `projects` tree;
  `journal.ts` derives the root rather than reading "no log" and saying nothing about the reader.
- **grok and hermes are not canary agents**, so their reducers are gated by `bun test
  bridge/journal/unknowns.test.ts` alone.

### Dialogs and busy (`--dialogs`, spec M37/03)

Two more scenarios, off by default because they make more model turns: about 8 for Claude, 4 for
Codex, 2 for OpenCode, 2 per agent for `busy`. Each opens its own panes.

| id        | what the canary does                                          | what must hold                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dialogs` | asks Claude for a Bash command, a WebFetch, an AskUserQuestion and (in a plan-mode pane) a plan; asks Codex (`-a on-request -s read-only`) for a command and a file edit; asks OpenCode (a scratch config that asks for bash and edit) for a command, opens its "Always allow" step and cancels it, then asks for a file edit | a choice card with the right family and labels, no card; the pointer on rows 1 to 3, the Tab amend note and "Type something" lock or unlock the buttons as the reader says; the declining key closes the dialog and the file is not written; Apple's key answers |
| `busy`    | starts a 500-word story, then sends "Queued note: reply with only OK." while Herdr says `working` | outcome `sent`, the note answered below it, and no unread card on any sample while the agent works |

Keys are pressed only where the recipe was measured live: a permission dialog's "No" digit,
Escape out of the amend note, an AskUserQuestion option's digit, Codex's decline, and on OpenCode
the buttons' own walk (`Right`, then `Enter`) for "Allow always", "Cancel" and "Reject", and Escape,
its declared cancel key, on the edit. "Confirm" is never pressed: it would allow the pattern until
OpenCode restarts. Plan approval is read and never answered. A dialog the model does not open (it answers in words instead) is
`not-reached`. The dialog screens are saved as `dialogs-<case>.ansi`.

## Verdicts

Whether a screen was reached is judged without Collie: Herdr's agent state and the screen's plain
text. What the phone makes of that screen is judged with Collie's readers only.

- `pass`: the screen came, and Collie read it right.
- `fail`: the screen came, and Collie read it wrong. The run exits 1.
- `not-reached`: the screen never came in time, for example a model turn that did not finish. It
  is never a pass, and it never fails the run.
- `known-gap`: a fail listed in `known-gaps.json`, with its reason and the issue, spec or ADR that
  owns the fix. The fix deletes the entry. A listed scenario that passes prints as a stale entry.

`--record` writes an agent into `web/src/lib/harness/verified-versions.json` (spec M37/01) with
`how: "canary"`, only after a complete default baseline with no fail anywhere and every result
for that agent passing. Partial runs, known gaps and unreached screens cannot certify a version. It
refuses when `--readers` points at another checkout, and it never creates the ledger.

A passing `journal` scenario also writes the JOURNAL reader's own line, in that entry's `journal`
block beside the screen reader's (spec M41/05). The two are recorded apart because they drift apart:
a vendor can change what it paints without changing what it writes. `bun run harness:drift` prints a
row per reader for that reason. A block is added by hand, never by a run — the canary refreshes
facts, it does not decide which readers an agent has.

## Cards and update checks

The adaptation inventory and hourly update watcher are described in [ADAPTATIONS.md](./ADAPTATIONS.md).

`cards` checks Codex model/reasoning, statusline configuration, Resume, Fork and Agents, plus
Claude model/effort menus, slash autocomplete, Marketplaces, Status/Config/Usage/Stats, Resume and Agents. Native headings are reached independently
of Collie's parser, then the real block and disabled composer are checked. Arrow moves only stage
selection; native cancellation restores the empty composer (Fork quits to its shell).

Opening the already-current Codex model can enter its reasoning picker; that picker is cancelled
without confirmation. A single small model turn seeds an owned conversation for Resume and Agents.
If a model returns an error, its outcome remains recorded separately; a saved error conversation
can still exercise card recognition. A missing native screen is `not-reached`, never a pass.

These probes use native keys in owned panes. Browser regressions separately cover guarded card
actions, including the Recent Models to Select Model entry. Hermes currently has fixture replay
and version-change reporting; its live card recipes remain pending.

Codex cards also observe the current statusline and cancel folder trust in a fresh temporary
directory. Agents uses `/agents`; a standalone CLI may report `Shared agents unavailable` and
remain pending. This does not certify the Left shortcut's external-writer/shared-server topology.
Native headings must be present on two consecutive reads; timers and paint can keep changing.
`--card-dialogs` adds only the focused command approval/question/permission probes; ordinary
`--dialogs` continues to include the broader dialog and busy baseline. `--screenshots` saves
phone-size replay images and an index after the owned live session has been cleaned up.

## How it stays off the operator's panes

- **Its own session.** The canary starts `herdr --session collie-canary server` and refuses to
  start when a session of that name exists. Every command carries `--session collie-canary` and
  `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH` set to that session's socket. The inherited `HERDR_*` variables are removed.
- **An owned-id check.** Every pane and workspace command checks the id against the ids this run
  created. The send path refuses any other pane too.
- **Its own Herdr config.** The session reads a temporary `config.toml` (`HERDR_CONFIG_PATH`) with
  sound, toasts, the update check and onboarding off. The operator's config is not read.
- **Teardown.** A `finally` and a SIGINT, SIGTERM and SIGHUP handler close the workspaces, stop
  and delete the session, and remove the project and config directories. The run ends with a
  `teardown: clean` line, or says what is left.

## The send path

The client's real `sendGuardedReply` (`web/src/lib/reply-action.ts`) runs in this process. Its
`fetch` is replaced by a shim (`transport.ts`) that answers `GET /api/pane/:id` with the bridge's
own `readPane`, and `POST /api/pane/:id/reply` with the bridge's own `replyPane`, both from
`bridge/server.ts`. The shim builds a Herdr adapter on the canary session's socket. So there is no
server, no port and no paired device. Any other route throws, because a new route means the send
path changed. The bridge's audit lines for each send are kept in `summary.json`, with the device
name `collie-canary`.

## Proof against 1.13.1

The canary fails on the two readers 1.13.2 fixed. To see it:

```sh
git worktree add /tmp/c1131 v1.13.1
ln -s "$PWD/web/node_modules" /tmp/c1131/web/node_modules
bun run canary --agent claude,codex --scenario idle,drafts,narrow,start-exit --readers /tmp/c1131
rm /tmp/c1131/web/node_modules && git worktree remove /tmp/c1131
```

On 2026-09-26 that run failed codex `idle` (composer not found, unread card), claude `drafts` on
`15-rule` (unread card, draft not read back) and claude `start-exit` (card after exit). On main
every scenario passed, except the listed codex `start-exit` gap. `--readers` swaps only the
`web/src/lib` readers and the reply action; the bridge side of the send path is this checkout's.

## Findings (2026-09-26, Herdr 0.9.0)

**Session targeting.** `herdr --session <name> <group> <verb>` targets a named session for `pane`,
`tab`, `workspace` and `agent`. The flag wins over an inherited `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH`.
`HERDR_SOCKET_PATH=<socket>` alone also works. A stopped session is an error
(`server_not_running`), never a fallback to the default session. `herdr --session <name> server`
starts a headless server. `herdr session stop <name>` returns before the server is gone, so
`herdr session delete <name>` must be retried until it succeeds.

**Pane size.** In a headless session with no client, a new pane is 119 columns wide. With a client
attached, Herdr sizes new panes from that client, also in tabs nobody views. The canary's client is
147 x 41, so its panes are 120 x 40. A `stty cols` wider than the pane wraps every full-width row,
so `--cols` stops at 119.

**Why the canary attaches a client.** A headless session answers no colour query (OSC 10, 11 and
4). Codex 0.156.1 then paints its composer with no background and its status separators with no
colour. On such a screen, main's Codex reader finds no composer, and every idle pane wears the
unread card. This matters outside the canary as well: a Codex started in a session no client ever
attached to looks like that. A person's terminal always answers, and Herdr answers a pane from what
its client reported. So the canary attaches one client of its own (`client.ts`) in a PTY it hosts
(`Bun.Terminal`), answers the colour queries with a fixed dark palette, and keeps the client on the
`canary-view` workspace. Nothing but those answers is ever written to it.

**Folder trust.** Both agents ask about the fresh project, and the canary answers like a person:

- Claude Code 2.1.283 starts the pointer on "No, exit", so the canary presses Down, re-reads, then
  presses Enter. Herdr reports this screen as `blocked`.
- Codex 0.156.1 asks even with `-c 'projects."<dir>".trust_level="trusted"'`, and even with `-a`
  and `-s`. Herdr reports this screen as `idle`, which is why readiness also needs no startup
  question on screen.
- A plain folder inside a trusted git repo inherits Codex trust; a nested git repo does not.

The project folder is always `/tmp/collie-canary-project`, emptied and rebuilt each run, so the
agents keep ONE trust entry for it in `~/.codex/config.toml` and ONE project entry in
`~/.claude.json`, not one per run. The canary does not edit those files. After the first run the
folder is trusted, so the trust question no longer appears; the canary still answers it when it does.

**Inherited markers.** A Claude started with `CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION` in its environment saves
no transcript and says so in the status row. The canary removes the `CLAUDE_CODE_*`, `CLAUDECODE`
and `HERDR_*` variables before it starts the server.

**Journal roots.** The journal scenario reads the logs the agents write into their ordinary homes:
the canary does not relocate `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `CODEX_HOME` or the rest, because an agent started
with a fresh config has no credentials and cannot run at all. So a run leaves one small session file
per agent behind, in that agent's own sessions directory, holding the canary's four prompts and one
read of a scratch `README.md`.

**Models.** claude runs Haiku (`--model haiku`), codex its default model at low effort
(`-c model_reasoning_effort="low"`), pi its default model with `--thinking off` and
`--no-session`, and opencode its default model. All are flags, none touches the operator's config.

**OpenCode's permission dialogs need a config.** OpenCode 1.18.32 asks before a tool only when its
config says `ask`. The dialogs scenario writes `opencode-ask.json` into the run's capture folder
(`permission` set to `ask` for `bash` and `edit`) and starts that one OpenCode with
`OPENCODE_CONFIG` pointing at it. OpenCode merges that file over its usual config for this one
process; nothing in `~/.config/opencode` is written.

## Traps kept from the hand runs

- Ctrl+C on an EMPTY Codex composer exits Codex. The canary never sends it to Codex; drafts are
  cleared with a Backspace sweep.
- Two Ctrl+C within about a second exit Claude. Ctrl+C is Claude's fallback only, sent once, then
  the canary waits 1.5 s.
- `herdr pane read --format ansi` returns raw text, not JSON. The canary reads panes through the
  bridge's `readPane` instead, which is what the phone reads.
