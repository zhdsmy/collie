//
// The shape it reads: a version's section groups its bullets under `### Added`, `### Changed`,
// `### Fixed`, `### Packaging` and `### Docs`, and every bullet opens with a bold lead sentence
// (`- **Lead sentence.** detail …`). The page lists the leads, one line per bullet, under the
// group's name, and links the changelog for the detail. That is the whole reason the lead is
// bold and short: it is the release page's own sentence, written once.
//
// A lead keeps its credit. When the bullet's detail credits someone ("Thanks @x (#12).",
// "Reported by @y (#34)."), the page line ends with that credit, so a reader sees who did what,
// and the @mention is what makes GitHub draw the release's Contributors avatars. See
// `creditsOf` for which @ counts.
//
// The order on the page is the reader's, not the file's. A phone arrives here from the in-app
// update banner to copy one command, so the update block is FIRST and is never folded into a
// `<details>` a thumb has to find. What changed comes second. Only the by-hand checksum recipe is
// folded, because the reader who wants it goes looking for it.
//
// Exit 1, with the reason on stderr, when the section cannot be read that way: no heading for the
// version, a bullet with no bold lead, a bullet sitting above any group heading, or a group
// heading that is not one of the five. A release page that silently lists nothing is worse than a
// workflow step that stops and says which bullet is wrong.
