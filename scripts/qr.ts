// Render a URL as a QR code in the terminal, so a phone can scan its way onto the bridge instead of
// typing a MagicDNS name on a phone keyboard. Called only by `collie-ctl.sh qr`, which decides WHICH
// url (the tailnet front door, or COLLIE_PUBLIC_URL under DEPLOYMENT.md's Variant C/E) and whether it's worth one.
//
// A plain dependency, NOT an optional one like web-push (bridge/push.ts). The distinction is which
// contract it belongs to: push is optional at RUNTIME (no VAPID keys, no push, bridge unaffected),
// whereas this is a first-class subcommand whose own test suite gates every push. Declaring it
// optional while `bun run test` can't pass without it would be two contracts disagreeing. The import
// is still guarded, because a checkout that hasn't run `bun install` yet should hear why rather than
// eat a module-resolution stack trace.

// Two things about qrcode-terminal's compact renderer have to be corrected here, and BOTH were found
// by decoding what it prints rather than by reading it (`qr.test.ts` keeps them found):
//
//  1. **Its filled glyph is a LIGHT module, not a dark one.** Verified against the encoder's own
//     `isDark()` matrix: the bitmap matches only with the glyph read as light. So the compact output
//     silently assumes a dark terminal — light foreground painting the light modules, background
//     showing through as the dark ones. On a LIGHT terminal every module inverts, and an inverted QR
//     is exactly what phone cameras are worst at. (The full-size renderer has no such problem — it
//     paints explicit ANSI backgrounds — but costs ~31 rows to the compact one's ~16.) Setting the
//     colours ourselves buys the compact size AND theme independence: one SGR per line pinning
//     bright-white on black, which maps each glyph to the polarity it was always meant to have.
//  2. **Its quiet zone is 2 modules top and 1 left**, where the spec asks for 4 all round. It gets
//     away with it when the terminal background happens to continue the light margin; against a
//     scrolled-up prompt it doesn't. We pad it out ourselves.
// Emitted unconditionally, including when stdout is a pipe or a file — deliberately, and this is the
// line that would change. The usual `isTTY` gate is wrong here because the colour is not decoration:
// it IS the polarity fix, so stripping it hands `collie-ctl.sh qr | less -R` (or any capture you then
// scan from) exactly the inverted code this renderer exists to prevent. Raw escapes in a redirect are
// the lesser problem, and the URL is printed as plain text below the code for anyone piping it.
