</p>

A phone web UI for your [Herdr](https://herdr.dev) agent herd, served over Tailscale. Open a URL, see
which agent is waiting on you, and answer it with your phone's keyboard.

The reply box is an ordinary text field, so your phone's own voice dictation works in it; Collie
ships none of its own.

It assumes a [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) tailnet — your phone and the host on the same one —
and it is **single-user**: one operator, one tailnet, no multi-tenant auth. If you need shared or
public access, Collie isn't built for it. Read the
[security note](#%EF%B8%8F-security--read-before-you-run-it) either way.

**Features**

- **React Router + Vite** — TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn, and a Bun bridge
- **A dashboard ranked by who needs you**, not by what changed last
- **Push notifications** the moment an agent is waiting on you
- **Quick actions and slash commands** per agent — tap, don't type
- **Special-keys pad** — `Esc`, `Ctrl+C`, arrows, combinable modifiers
- **Find in output**, and **conversation history** the terminal can't scroll back to
- **Send an image** from your camera roll
- **Switch between Herdr sessions** without touching the host
- **Installs to your home screen** (PWA) and runs entirely on your own machine — loopback bind, no
  cloud, no account

## Demo

A run through the herd from a phone: the dashboard floats the agent that **needs you** to the top,
you drill into a space's tabs and panes (long-press a pane pill or a tab chip to rename or close it —
and a Claude pane shows the name you gave it with `/rename`), answer an `AskUserQuestion` prompt with
a tap, switch between herds, and pick up a push notification the moment an agent is waiting on input.

## ⚠️ Security — read before you run it

**Collie is remote shell access to your machine, by design.** One bridge call types arbitrary
keystrokes into a live terminal pane, so anyone who can reach the URL can read every pane (source,
secrets, env, agent output) and run any command as your user. No sandbox, no command allow-list
(that would defeat the purpose). Treat the URL like a root login.

The sharp edges:

- **It acts as _you_**, with your full privileges — `~/.ssh`, `git push --force`, `rm -rf`, `sudo`.
- **Access is device-level, not person-level.** Tailscale proves the device, not who's holding it —
  no password, no session, so an unlocked or stolen phone is an open shell. The idle lock pauses an
  unattended screen and gates nothing (details:
  [ADR 0007](./.adr/0007-the-idle-lock-is-a-pause-not-a-gate.md)).
- **Every uid on the host can reach it.** Herdr's socket is a file, so its permissions keep other
  local users out; Collie's port is TCP, so they're all in. The per-device gate closes the write half
  of that; reads stay open, so it bounds damage, not disclosure (details:
  [ARCHITECTURE.md §6](./ARCHITECTURE.md#6-security-model)).
- **One bridge fronts _every_ session** under your config root by default, sandbox ones included
  (details: [Multi-session](#multi-session)).
- **Every write is appended to `<state-dir>/audit.log`** — replies, keys, uploads, pane and tab
  create/close. A trail is not a gate (details:
  [ARCHITECTURE.md §6](./ARCHITECTURE.md#6-security-model)).
- **The defenses:** loopback bind only, never `0.0.0.0`; exactly one hardened front door —
  `tailscale serve` or a conforming reverse proxy, never `funnel` and never a bare port; a
  same-origin gate and a strict CSP, with pane output rendered as React text nodes rather than
  `innerHTML`. Two settings are yours to switch on, and you should: `COLLIE_TRUSTED_USER` rejects any
  tailnet login but yours, and `COLLIE_PUBLIC_HOSTS` blocks DNS rebinding (effectively mandatory
  under `COLLIE_SERVE_MODE=http`). Authorising individual *devices* needs a proxy in front — see
  [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](./DEPLOYMENT.md).

> 🚫 **Never `tailscale funnel` this** — funnel exposes it to the public internet; `serve` keeps it
> tailnet-only. There is no scenario where funneling Collie is correct.

Narrow the blast radius with Tailscale ACLs and `COLLIE_TRUSTED_USER`. Provided as-is, no warranty.

## Requirements

On the **host** (the tailnet node your agents run on). Need Herdr 0.7.0+ — check with
`herdr --version`.

| Tool | Why |
| --- | --- |
| [**Bun**](https://bun.sh) | Runs the bridge and builds the web UI — the only hard dependency. |
| [**Herdr**](https://herdr.dev) ≥ 0.7.0 | The herd Collie mirrors; its CLI registers the plugin. |
| [**Tailscale**](https://tailscale.com) | Front door for the default variant (`tailscale serve`); optional if you run [Variant C](./DEPLOYMENT.md#variant-c--reverse-proxy-as-the-only-front-door-no-tailscale) behind your own reverse proxy. Without any front door, the bridge is `127.0.0.1`-only. |
| **git** | Clone, and the `update` command. |

Soft dependencies: **Node.js** (the control script uses it to extract your MagicDNS name from
`tailscale status --json`; without it the banner falls back to the loopback URL) and a **service
supervisor** — `systemd --user` on Linux, **launchd** on macOS (both ship with the OS); a host with
neither falls back to an unsupervised `nohup` process. You never install JS
deps by hand — the build runs `bun install` for you; the backend imports only Bun + `node:*`.
[`web-push`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-push) is optional and lazy (see [Web
Push](#web-push-optional)).

**Linux and macOS are the supported hosts.** The bridge itself also runs on **Windows**
(experimental) against Herdr's Windows beta — see [Windows](#windows-experimental).

## Install

On the host, not your phone. Two ways in.

**From GitHub (turnkey)** — Herdr fetches and builds for you:

```bash
herdr plugin install AltanS/collie
herdr plugin action invoke start --plugin herdr.collie
```

**From a local clone (for development)** — registered by path:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AltanS/collie.git && cd collie
herdr plugin link "$(pwd)"
herdr plugin action invoke start --plugin herdr.collie
```

Either way, `start` does four things:

1. **builds** `web/dist` if it's missing (typechecked, staged, swapped in atomically),
2. **starts the bridge** as the `systemd --user` service `collie` (`nohup` fallback without systemd),
3. **publishes it on the tailnet** — literally `tailscale serve --bg 8787`: HTTPS on the host's
   MagicDNS name, `:443 → 127.0.0.1:8787`, tailnet-only,
4. **prints the banner** with the URL to open — walked through line by line in
   [First run](#first-run--what-youll-see).

> No Herdr? Run `scripts/collie-ctl.sh start` directly — same effect (config then lives in
> `~/.config/collie/.env`).

## First run — what you'll see

The transcripts below are the control script's inline output. **Through `invoke start` you get
Herdr's JSON envelope instead** — the same text is the action's *captured stdout*, read with
`herdr plugin log list --plugin herdr.collie`.

```console
$ scripts/collie-ctl.sh start
building web UI (first run)…                    # linked clone only; a GitHub install already built
…bun install · typecheck · vite build output…
bridge started (systemd --user: collie)
tailscale serve (https) → tailnet :443 -> 127.0.0.1:8787

  ✓ Collie is running  ·  v0.15.0+174c4e4
    service   systemd --user (collie) · active
    local     http://127.0.0.1:8787
    tailnet   https://myhost.tail1234.ts.net
```

The `✓` is a real probe — the script connected to the bridge's port and got an answer, not just
"the unit is active". If you get `⚠ Collie isn't answering on :8787 yet` instead, see
[Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

### What just happened

`start` left three durable things on the host:

1. **`web/dist`** — the built UI, served from disk, so later rebuilds go live without a restart.
2. **A supervised user service** — a `systemd --user` unit named `collie`, or a launchd agent on
   macOS ([Surviving reboots](#surviving-reboots) has the details of both).
3. **A tailnet-only `tailscale serve` mapping** — HTTPS on the host's MagicDNS name,
   `:443 → 127.0.0.1:8787`, TLS terminated by Tailscale. Inspect with `tailscale serve status`;
   remove just this mapping with `scripts/collie-ctl.sh unserve`.

`stop` merely pauses the service; `uninstall` reverses 2 + 3 and keeps your `.env` and the checkout.
Why a service and not a Herdr pane: [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) §3.

### Open it on your phone

The URL is the banner's `tailnet` line — print it again anytime with `scripts/collie-ctl.sh url`, or
`scripts/collie-ctl.sh qr` to print it as a QR code you can scan. It resolves for any device on your
tailnet, so the phone needs the Tailscale app installed and connected to the same tailnet as the
host.

Then install it as an app: **iOS** — Safari → share sheet → *Add to Home Screen*. **Android** —
Chrome → ⋮ menu → *Add to Home screen* (or *Install app*). Installing (and Web Push) needs the
HTTPS origin the default serve mode already provides; over `COLLIE_SERVE_MODE=http` the page works,
but service worker and install silently no-op.

### Is it actually working?

A sixty-second check, host side then phone side:

```console
$ scripts/collie-ctl.sh status

  ✓ Collie is running  ·  v0.15.0+174c4e4
    service   systemd --user (collie) · active
    local     http://127.0.0.1:8787
    tailnet   https://myhost.tail1234.ts.net

  serve config:
    https://myhost.tail1234.ts.net (tailnet only)
    |-- / proxy http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

```console
$ scripts/collie-ctl.sh logs        # journal timestamps trimmed here
[push] disabled (no VAPID keys configured)
[bridge] listening on http://127.0.0.1:8787  (poll 1500ms)
[bridge] WARNING: COLLIE_TRUSTED_USER is empty — any tailnet device/user that reaches the bridge gets full write access. Set it to your tailnet login (see README → Variant A).
[bridge] WARNING: COLLIE_PUBLIC_HOSTS is empty — Host-header validation is OFF (DNS rebinding not blocked). Set it to your MagicDNS name, especially under COLLIE_SERVE_MODE=http.
```

**Both WARNINGs are expected on a fresh install** — that's the bridge telling you it's running
open-by-default on your tailnet. [Configure](#configure) closes both. (The loopback URL in the log
is also correct: the bridge itself only ever binds `127.0.0.1` — `tailscale serve` is what makes it
reachable.) `[push] disabled` is expected too: notifications are opt-in, and
[Web Push](#web-push-optional) is three commands.

On the phone: your agents are listed, and the footer build stamp (`v0.9.0 · debcff9 · …`) matches
`scripts/collie-ctl.sh version`. If the page loads but stays empty, that's the same-origin gate —
see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

## Configure

Out of the box Collie runs **open single-user**: anyone on your tailnet who can reach the URL has
full control — that's exactly what the two startup WARNINGs are about. Close both in one sitting:

```bash
# in your .env
COLLIE_TRUSTED_USER=you@example.com           # your tailnet login — the bridge rejects anyone else
COLLIE_PUBLIC_HOSTS=myhost.tail1234.ts.net    # exact host(s) you serve on — blocks DNS rebinding
```

Config is a `.env` in the plugin's config dir — find it with
`herdr plugin config-dir herdr.collie` (typically `~/.config/herdr/plugins/config/herdr.collie`;
without Herdr, `~/.config/collie`). `collie-ctl.sh` resolves this same dir whether you run it
directly or via a Herdr action:

```bash
cp .env.example "$(herdr plugin config-dir herdr.collie)/.env"
```

The bridge reads `.env` only at startup — after any edit, `scripts/collie-ctl.sh restart`. See
[`.env.example`](./.env.example) for the full option list — commonly `COLLIE_PORT`, or
`COLLIE_SERVE_MODE=http` (Headscale / `.internal` domains; read by the control script when it runs
`tailscale serve`).

Reading history from more than one agent home? List them all in `COLLIE_TRANSCRIPT_ROOT`,
comma-separated.

**Custom domain or reverse proxy?** [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](./DEPLOYMENT.md) has the full front-door setup.
The one rule to know here: Collie is same-origin only, so a different hostname or TLS terminator
needs the exact origin allowed —

```bash
COLLIE_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://collie.example.com
```

— and until you do, the page loads and stays empty
([Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) has the symptom).

### Your own slash commands

Commands only this machine has (a plugin's `/fork-in-herdr`, your own `/deploy`) go in
`commands.toml`:

```bash
cp commands.toml.example "$(herdr plugin config-dir herdr.collie)/commands.toml"
```

```toml
[[commands]]
scope = "omp"                # optional; omit for every pane
command = "/fork-in-herdr"
description = "Fork this conversation into a new herdr tab"
```

A pane your rows match shows only your rows (narrowest row wins,
[ADR 0018](./.adr/0018-operator-command-rows-replace-the-catalog.md)). Add `confirm = true` for a
two-tap confirm. No restart — edits are live. Verify: open a pane, tap **/**, your rows are on the
first screen. Syntax error? `journalctl --user -u collie -n 20` names the line.

### Your own key presets

The Keys tray's **Presets** row is yours to replace, in `keys.toml` next to `commands.toml`:

```bash
cp keys.toml.example "$(herdr plugin config-dir herdr.collie)/keys.toml"
```

```toml
[[keys]]
scope = "claude"             # optional; omit for every pane
label = "Yes"
keys = ["Down", "Enter"]     # several chords go out as one batch
```

A pane your rows match shows only your presets, in place of the shipped Ctrl C/D/U/R/L/Z
([ADR 0018](./.adr/0018-operator-command-rows-replace-the-catalog.md)). Add `danger = true` for a
two-tap confirm. The rest of the tray — Esc, arrows, Enter/Tab/Space, modifiers, digits, F1–F12 —
is fixed and not configurable. Chords are herdr's spelling: `ctrl+c` (never `C-c`), `shift+tab`,
`ctrl+F7`; `PageUp`/`Home`/`End`/`Delete` are not accepted. No restart — edits are live. Verify:
open a pane, tap **Keys → Presets**, your buttons are there. Rejected row?
`journalctl --user -u collie -n 20` names it and why.

### Multi-session

`COLLIE_MULTI_SESSION=on` (the default) discovers and serves every named Herdr session under your
config root, switchable from the header; `COLLIE_MULTI_SESSION=off` serves only the primary one. Every
session it finds is drivable through the same URL — including a private or sandbox one, which is why
[Security](#%EF%B8%8F-security--read-before-you-run-it) lists this as a sharp edge.

## Dark mode / light mode

**Collie follows your phone by default.** To pin it, open **Settings → Appearance** and pick
**System**, **Light** or **Dark** — per device, stored in the browser.

The terminal mirror is the exception: it always renders on a **dark ground** and light mode *inverts*
it rather than re-colouring it. Agents emit absolute colours chosen for a black terminal, and
inverting is what keeps the contrast they designed for
([ADR 0002](./.adr/0002-invert-the-light-terminal-mirror.md) has the measurement). So keep your
agents on a dark theme — a light-themed agent emits dark-on-light colours that are unreadable under
either appearance. (Installed on iOS, the status-bar text stays white in light mode; iOS gives web
apps no way to change that at runtime.)

## Commands

Every command works two ways: the **control script** on the host (`scripts/collie-ctl.sh <cmd>`) or
the equivalent **Herdr action** (`herdr plugin action invoke <cmd> --plugin herdr.collie`, written
below as `invoke <cmd>`). The ones you'll actually use:

| Action | Control script | Herdr action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Start** — build if needed, serve, print the URL | `collie-ctl.sh start` | `invoke start` |
| **Stop** — pause the bridge; removes nothing | `collie-ctl.sh stop` | `invoke stop` |
| **Restart** | `collie-ctl.sh restart` | `invoke restart` |
| **Status** — the *Collie is running* banner + URLs | `collie-ctl.sh status` | `invoke status` |
| **URL** — print the tailnet URL | `collie-ctl.sh url` | `invoke url` |
| **QR** — the same URL as a scannable code | `collie-ctl.sh qr` | — (script only) |
| **Version** — the running version (`0.x.y+sha`) | `collie-ctl.sh version` | `invoke version` |
| **Update** — advance the checkout + rebuild + restart | `collie-ctl.sh update` | `invoke update` |
| **Uninstall** — remove the service; keep `.env` + checkout | `collie-ctl.sh uninstall` | `invoke uninstall` |
| **Logs** — tail the journal / log file | `collie-ctl.sh logs` | — (script only) |
| **Push keys** — generate the VAPID keypair into your `.env` | `collie-ctl.sh push-keys` | `invoke push-keys` |
| **Push test** — send one notification to prove it works | `collie-ctl.sh push-test` | `invoke push-test` |

The actions are declared in `herdr-plugin.toml` and each one shells out to the control script; list
them live with `herdr plugin action list --plugin herdr.collie`. `build` · `serve` · `unserve` are
script-only too.

`start` and `status` end with the **Collie is running** banner — annotated line by line in
[First run](#first-run--what-youll-see). Its version comes from the *served* bundle stamp, so it is
the authoritative "what's running". **Through a Herdr action you get Herdr's JSON envelope, not the
banner** — the human-readable output is the action's *captured stdout*, read with
`herdr plugin log list --plugin herdr.collie` (or run the control script directly to see it inline).

## Manage & update

### Stop or uninstall

Pause the bridge without removing anything (a later `start` brings it right back):

```bash
scripts/collie-ctl.sh stop      # or: herdr plugin action invoke stop --plugin herdr.collie
```

To tear the service down completely — stop + disable it, remove the service definition (the
`systemd --user` unit, or the launchd agent plist on macOS), and remove
Collie's own `tailscale serve` mapping (port-scoped, so other tailnet mappings on the host survive) —
use `uninstall`. It leaves your `.env` and the checkout untouched:

```bash
scripts/collie-ctl.sh uninstall # or: herdr plugin action invoke uninstall --plugin herdr.collie
```

Then `herdr plugin uninstall herdr.collie` (or, for a linked clone, just deleting the directory)
removes the plugin registration itself.

### Update to a new release

The checkout *is* the plugin, and Herdr has no `plugin update` of its own. One command does the lot:

```bash
scripts/collie-ctl.sh update    # or: herdr plugin action invoke update --plugin herdr.collie
```

It advances the checkout, rebuilds the UI and restarts the bridge (re-execing itself, so it's safe
even when the update rewrites the script). Confirm via the footer build stamp. Pinned to a version
with `--ref`? Keep refreshing with `herdr plugin install --ref …`.

**`update` goes to the newest release of the major you are on, and never crosses one.** A major
means you have to change something, so it is never inherited from a routine update: the command says
a new major is out and names the one that takes it —

```bash
herdr plugin action invoke update-major --plugin herdr.collie   # or: scripts/collie-ctl.sh update --major
```

The flag is the whole consent; there is no prompt, because a Herdr action has no terminal to answer
one on. The reasoning is [ADR 0020](./.adr/0020-a-major-upgrade-is-consented-by-flag.md).

Fails with *"You are not currently on a branch"*? That's a GitHub install made before 0.23.1, and
[Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) has the one-time repair.

#### What `update` actually does to the checkout

The two install routes differ in *when* the UI builds — a GitHub install at install time, via the
manifest's `[[build]]` step; a linked clone on first `start`.

They also leave two different shapes on disk, which is what `update` has to cope with.
`herdr plugin install` doesn't clone: it fetches one commit and detaches onto it, so the checkout has
no branch. A linked clone sits on one, the way you'd expect.

One command handles both ([ADR 0006](./.adr/0006-update-advances-the-checkout-herdr-installed.md)):

- **Linked clone** (on a branch) — `git pull --ff-only`, then **re-links the plugin** so Herdr picks
  up any new actions and the new version.
- **`herdr plugin install`** (detached, shallow) — fetches the default-branch tip and re-detaches onto
  it. `--depth 1` only if it's already shallow, so a full history is never truncated; `--force` so a
  lockfile the build rewrote can't wedge the *next* update. It deliberately does **not** re-link:
  linking re-registers the plugin as a local path, after which Herdr refuses `herdr plugin install` —
  which is your recovery path if this checkout ever breaks.

By hand: frontend (`web/`) → `collie-ctl.sh build` (live, no restart — served from disk); backend
(`bridge/`) → `systemctl --user restart collie`. Run `scripts/install-hooks.sh` once to enable the
repo's pre-commit / pre-push checks.

## When 1.0 arrives

Collie 1.0.0 will be a MAJOR release: something about your setup will need your attention before
you take it. This release is the gatekeeper that makes that safe:

- A routine `update` now follows release tags **within major 0** — it will never carry you into
  1.0 on its own. (Older versions update straight to whatever the default branch holds; staying
  below 0.32.0 means staying unprotected.)
- When 1.0.0 is published, the update banner announces it separately from routine updates. Read
  its release notes first, then consent to the crossing with:
  `herdr plugin action invoke update-major --plugin herdr.collie`

### Surviving reboots

A `systemd --user` service only runs while you have a login session. On a host that should serve
Collie unattended, enable lingering once:

```bash
loginctl enable-linger $USER
```

The unit is `enable`d, so with lingering it starts at boot with your user manager; the
`tailscale serve` mapping is persistent (`--bg`) and comes back on its own. Inspect the unit with
`systemctl --user status collie`.

**On macOS there's nothing to enable.** `start` installs a launchd agent
(`~/Library/LaunchAgents/herdr.collie.plist`) with `RunAtLoad`, so the bridge comes back when you log
in and launchd restarts it if it exits abnormally. Inspect it with
`launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/herdr.collie`. It's a *LaunchAgent*, not a daemon, so it starts at
**login** rather than at boot — a Mac sitting at the login window is not serving Collie. (Neither
supervisor? A `nohup` process with a pidfile in the config dir instead.)

## Deployment variants

The bridge always binds **loopback only**; what changes between deployments is *what sits in front
of it* and *how a request proves who it is*. Variant A is the default and sits below; the other four
are in [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](./DEPLOYMENT.md). Pick one.

### Variant A — `tailscale serve` + person identity (default)

The happy path from [Install](#install). `tailscale serve` terminates TLS on your MagicDNS name and
injects `Tailscale-User-Login`; set `COLLIE_TRUSTED_USER` to your tailnet login and the bridge
rejects anyone else.

```bash
# in your .env
COLLIE_TRUSTED_USER=you@example.com
```

- **Granularity:** the tailnet *person*, not the device.
- **Why it's safe on bare `tailscale serve`:** serve is the *trusted injector* of
  `Tailscale-User-Login` — it sets that header itself and a client can't forge it through the proxy.
- Nothing else to configure; origins match automatically on the MagicDNS name.

This is the right choice unless you specifically need per-device control. If you do, or if Tailscale
isn't in the path at all, [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](./DEPLOYMENT.md) has the rest:

- **[B — identity-aware proxy, authorised by device](./DEPLOYMENT.md#variant-b--identity-aware-proxy--per-device-authorisation)** — a proxy on this host; some devices drive, others watch.
- **[C — reverse proxy as the only front door](./DEPLOYMENT.md#variant-c--reverse-proxy-as-the-only-front-door-no-tailscale)** — no Tailscale anywhere in the path.
- **[D — off-host identity proxy over the tailnet](./DEPLOYMENT.md#variant-d--off-host-identity-proxy-over-the-tailnet)** — one central ingress node fronting Collie among your other services.
- **[E — any other mesh or tunnel](./DEPLOYMENT.md#variant-e--any-other-mesh-or-tunnel-netbird-zerotier-cloudflare-tunnel)** — NetBird, ZeroTier, Cloudflare Tunnel: you own the ingress, Collie publishes nothing.

## Windows (experimental)

The **bridge** runs on Windows against Herdr's Windows beta; the **launcher** does not. Herdr there
exposes its control socket as a *named pipe* named after the full socket path, not an AF_UNIX
socket, so Collie dials it through `node:net` instead of `Bun.connect` — one shim,
[`bridge/dial.ts`](./bridge/dial.ts), which explains the mapping at the top of the file.

What that means in practice:

- **Run the bridge directly** — `bun run bridge/index.ts`. There's no systemd unit, and the Herdr
  action buttons shell out to `bash`, so they only work if Git Bash is on `PATH`. The manifest
  therefore still declares `linux`/`macos` only, rather than advertising buttons that may not fire.
- **`tailscale serve` isn't wired up here.** Use the
  [Variant C](./DEPLOYMENT.md#variant-c--reverse-proxy-as-the-only-front-door-no-tailscale) posture: loopback bind, your own ingress in front, `COLLIE_PUBLIC_HOSTS` pinned. The security
  rules in [§Security](#%EF%B8%8F-security--read-before-you-run-it) are not relaxed on Windows.
- **Set `COLLIE_MULTI_SESSION=off`** — session discovery derives POSIX paths.
- The socket path defaults to `%APPDATA%\herdr\herdr.sock`; override with `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH`
  (an explicit `\\.\pipe\…` value is passed through untouched).

**Want the lifecycle too?** The bridge has spoken Windows' named pipe since 0.15.0; a
community-maintained Task Scheduler setup (start/stop/update, no supported-tree guarantees) lives in
[`contrib/windows/`](./contrib/windows/README.md).

**Is it actually working?** The bridge logs `[events] stream up` on start — the event stream works
over the pipe, so Windows gets the same live updates as Linux, not degraded polling.

`COLLIE_HERDR_DIAL=net` forces that same dialer on Linux/macOS. It exists so the Windows code path
can be exercised — and regression-tested — without a Windows box; `bridge/dial.test.ts` uses it.

## Web Push (optional)

Off unless you opt in. Three steps, and nothing to install — the sender (`web-push`) is already an
optional dependency, installed by the build:

```bash
herdr plugin action invoke push-keys --plugin herdr.collie   # 1. generate + write the VAPID keys
herdr plugin action invoke restart   --plugin herdr.collie   # 2. the bridge reads them at start
#                                                              3. on your phone: Settings → notifications
```

Step 1 is the one that used to be fiddly. `push-keys` generates the keypair *and* writes
`COLLIE_VAPID_PUBLIC` / `_PRIVATE` into the `.env` the service actually reads, at mode 600.

**Worth one extra keystroke:** pass a *subject* — the contact address RFC 8292 wants, so a push
service has a way to reach whoever is sending. An action carries no arguments, so this form is the
shell one:

```bash
bash scripts/collie-ctl.sh push-keys mailto:you@example.com
```

Two behaviours worth knowing. It **refuses to replace keys that are already live** unless you pass
`--force`, because new keys invalidate every existing subscription: each device must re-enable
notifications, and until it does it silently receives nothing. But passing a subject on an
already-configured install is *not* that — it updates the contact address and leaves the keys alone,
so fixing a typo never costs you your subscribers.

> **On a Herdr install older than 0.8.0**, actions are the set cached when the plugin was installed
> ([ADR 0006](./.adr/0006-update-advances-the-checkout-herdr-installed.md)), so `push-keys` and
> `push-test` won't appear until the next `herdr plugin install`. Use
> `bash scripts/collie-ctl.sh push-keys` until then — it does the identical thing.

**Did it work?** Fire a notification at every subscribed device without waiting for an agent to
block:

```bash
bash scripts/collie-ctl.sh push-test                 # or: push-test "Title" "Body"
```

You should get it within a second or two. If it says push is disabled, the bridge didn't get the keys
— restart it (step 2). If it says there are no subscribed devices, step 3 hasn't happened on that
phone yet.

Push needs a **secure context (HTTPS)**, which any HTTPS-terminating front door provides — the
default `tailscale serve` (Tailscale manages the MagicDNS cert; nothing to obtain or renew) or a
[Variant C](./DEPLOYMENT.md#variant-c--reverse-proxy-as-the-only-front-door-no-tailscale) proxy that
terminates TLS. Plain-HTTP modes (`COLLIE_SERVE_MODE=http`) are **not** a secure context, so the
browser won't even offer the subscribe button — Settings flags it `insecure`.

Collie pushes when an agent goes **blocked** or **done**, with the agent's message in the body;
**tapping it opens Collie at that agent**.

## Troubleshooting

Symptoms below, in order — search the page for yours. **`Os { NotFound }` from `herdr plugin`** ·
**`update` says "not currently on a branch"** · **`tailscale serve failed`** · **isn't answering
(service won't start)** · **phone can't open the URL** · **page loads but stays empty (blank page,
403)** · **a password prompt won't take your reply** · **no push notifications** · **gone after a
reboot** · **`herdr plugin list` shows the old version** · **stale UI after a rebuild**.

**`herdr plugin …` fails with `Error: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: "No such file or
directory" }`** (plugin install fails, action invoke fails)**.** This is *not* a Collie problem — it
means the **Herdr server isn't running**, so its CLI can't reach the control socket
(`~/.config/herdr/herdr.sock`). The tell is the *raw* `Os {…}`
error: a reachable server answers path/manifest problems with structured JSON (e.g.
`plugin_manifest_not_found`), so a bare `Os { NotFound }` is a failed socket connect, before Collie
or your path is ever examined. It hits `link`, `install`, `action invoke` — every subcommand that
talks to the server — while `herdr plugin --help` still works (it never opens the socket). Fix: start
Herdr first (`herdr server &`, or just launch the Herdr TUI — it boots the server), confirm
`ls ~/.config/herdr/herdr.sock` now exists, then retry the install. `herdr plugin list` is a quick
probe: if it throws the same error, the server is down.

**`update` fails with `You are not currently on a branch`.** A GitHub install made before **0.23.1**
([#63](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/issues/63)). `herdr plugin install` fetches one commit and
detaches onto it rather than cloning, so the old `update` — which ran `git pull` — had no branch to
pull into, and no install of that vintage could refresh itself. The fix ships inside the checkout it
repairs, so it takes one reinstall to land; `update` works normally from then on:

```bash
herdr plugin install AltanS/collie --yes          # replaces the checkout, rebuilds the UI
herdr plugin action invoke restart --plugin herdr.collie   # reinstall doesn't restart the service
herdr plugin action invoke version --plugin herdr.collie   # expect 0.23.1 or newer
```

Your `.env` and `tailscale serve` state live in the plugin config dir, outside the checkout, so they
survive.

**`start` prints `note: tailscale serve failed`.** The bridge itself is fine (still up on
`127.0.0.1`) — only the tailnet ingress didn't come up, and the script prints tailscale's own error
right below the note. Usual causes: your user isn't the Tailscale operator
(`sudo tailscale set --operator=$USER`), the node is logged out (`tailscale up`), or — on
Headscale / `.internal` tailnet domains — HTTPS certs aren't available, which is exactly what
`COLLIE_SERVE_MODE=http` is for: set it in `.env`, then `scripts/collie-ctl.sh restart`. Verify with
`tailscale serve status`.

**Banner shows `⚠ Collie isn't answering on :8787 yet`** (service won't start, connection
refused)**.** The service was started but the HTTP server isn't answering the probe. Check the unit
first — `systemctl --user status collie` — then `scripts/collie-ctl.sh logs` (or
`journalctl --user -u collie -f` to watch live) for why: most commonly the port is already taken
(set `COLLIE_PORT` in `.env`, then `scripts/collie-ctl.sh restart`, which also re-runs
`tailscale serve` against the new port) or the first build failed (the log says so; fix and run `scripts/collie-ctl.sh build`). The unit
auto-restarts every 5 s, so once the cause is fixed it usually comes back on its own.

**Phone can't open the tailnet URL.** Work down the list: (1) the phone runs the Tailscale app and
is *connected* to the same tailnet as the host; (2) you're opening the banner's `tailnet` URL
(`scripts/collie-ctl.sh url`), not the `local` one — `http://127.0.0.1:8787` only works on the host
itself; (3) MagicDNS is enabled in your tailnet's DNS settings (the URL is a MagicDNS name); (4) the
host is online — check `tailscale status` on the host, or ping the host from the phone's Tailscale
app; (5) **your tailnet policy actually admits a peer to this node** — if it doesn't, the banner now
says so under the `tailnet` line, and nothing else will: the front door is published correctly, the
cert is valid, and `curl` from the host itself returns 200, because loopback never touches the packet
filter. Two things make this one especially misleading — `tailscale ping` **succeeds** (disco pings
bypass ACLs), and blocked traffic is dropped rather than refused, so the phone just hangs and reads
as "server down". Fix it in your ACL policy (<https://login.tailscale.com/admin/acls> on Tailscale;
your policy file on Headscale). The check is best-effort and deliberately unsure of itself: it speaks
up only when this node's filter admits *nothing* — which can equally mean no other device has joined
the tailnet yet — and stays quiet whenever it can't tell.

**Page loads but stays empty** (blank page, white screen); **API calls fail
`403 cross-origin rejected`.** You're reaching Collie through an origin the bridge doesn't expect — a
custom domain, or a proxy that rewrites `Host`. Allow the exact public origin with
`COLLIE_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (see [Configure](#configure)), or make the proxy forward `Host` unchanged —
the fourth proxy requirement in
[`DEPLOYMENT.md`](./DEPLOYMENT.md#variant-b--identity-aware-proxy--per-device-authorisation).

**A `sudo` (or SSH passphrase, or `gpg`) prompt won't take your reply.** Use **Type** in the
Controls row, not Send. Send *verifies* what it typed by reading it back off the screen before it
presses Enter ([#34](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/issues/34)), and a password prompt turns echo
off, so there is nothing to read back — **Type** sends your keystrokes straight to the pane, Enter
included. Nothing you type in **Type** is stored, echoed into a draft, or restored later, and the
moment Collie recognises a password prompt it drops the stored draft too
([#103](https://github.com/AltanS/collie/issues/103)).

**No push notifications arriving.** Fire one by hand: `bash scripts/collie-ctl.sh push-test`. Three
causes, in the order the command distinguishes them:
push says it's disabled (the keys never reached the bridge — run `push-keys` and restart, see
[Web Push](#web-push-optional)); it says there are no subscribed devices (this phone never enabled
them in Settings → notifications); or it reports a send and nothing arrives (the phone is on a
plain-HTTP origin, which is not a secure context — Settings flags it `insecure`).

**Collie is gone after a reboot.** On Linux this is almost always lingering — see
[Surviving reboots](#surviving-reboots) for the one command. On macOS the launchd agent starts at
**login**, so check you're actually logged in (not sitting at the login window) and that the agent is
loaded: `launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/herdr.collie`.

**`herdr plugin list` shows the old version after an `update`.** Expected — Herdr caches the manifest
it read at install or link time. The authority on what's running is the footer build stamp, or
`scripts/collie-ctl.sh version`. For a linked clone `update` re-links and that self-heals (force it
with `herdr plugin link "$(pwd)"`); on Herdr ≥0.8.0 the manifest is re-read from disk anyway.

**Phone shows a stale UI after a rebuild.** A PWA's service-worker cache is per-origin, so reaching
Collie at two origins (a custom domain *and* the raw `host:8787`) gives you two installs, each
caching its own bundle. The footer **build stamp** (`vX.Y.Z · sha · time`) shows the bundle you're
running; the bridge reports what it serves via the `X-Collie-Build` header and `/api/config`. On a
mismatch, the footer offers **"new build — tap to update."** Otherwise reopen the PWA a couple times
(the SW auto-updates) or clear that origin's site data. Best practice: **pick one HTTPS origin and
stick to it.** (Over plain HTTP the SW can't register — always fresh, but no PWA features.)

## Architecture

A small Bun process sits between your phone and Herdr — the browser never touches the socket.

```
  phone (PWA)
     │  HTTPS over the tailnet
     ▼
  tailscale serve        terminates TLS, injects the identity header
     │  127.0.0.1:PORT    (the bridge binds loopback only)
     ▼
  Collie bridge (Bun)    serves the UI + a small JSON API; polls Herdr
     │  one-shot JSON-RPC over a Unix socket
     ▼
  Herdr server           owns the panes, agents and terminal state
```

Under [Variant C](./DEPLOYMENT.md#variant-c--reverse-proxy-as-the-only-front-door-no-tailscale) a
reverse proxy replaces the `tailscale serve` box; everything below the front door is identical.

- **One module touches the socket** (`bridge/herdr-client.ts`); everything else speaks the bridge's HTTP API.
- **Polling is still the model** — the bridge polls Herdr (via `session.snapshot`, one RPC per tick) and the browser polls `/api/snapshot`; a long-lived Herdr event stream only pokes the bridge's poll to go faster, it never replaces it. No resync logic.
- **Actions are plain HTTP** — a reply or key `POST`s to `/api/pane/:id/{reply,keys}` → Herdr `pane.send_keys`, which types into a real terminal (hence the security posture).
- **The UI is a static PWA** — Vite builds `web/dist`, served from disk, so a rebuild is live with no restart.

Full design rationale in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Developing this plugin

Clone it and `herdr plugin link` it ([Install](#install) above), then edit in place.

- **The manifest is the plugin.** `herdr-plugin.toml` declares the actions listed in
  [Commands](#commands), and each one shells out to `scripts/collie-ctl.sh`. Both are
  commented — read them, not a paraphrase of them here.
- **One asymmetry in the dev loop:** `web/` rebuilds go live with no restart (the bridge serves
  `web/dist` from disk); `bridge/` changes need `systemctl --user restart collie`. Build, test and
  versioning rules are in [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) — versioning is hook-enforced, so skim it before
  your first commit.
- **Why a supervised service and not a plugin pane** — [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) §3.
  That decision is why the manifest uses `[[actions]]` and `[[build]]` and nothing else.
